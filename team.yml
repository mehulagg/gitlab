  story: |
    Sid saw the first ruby code in 2007 and loved it so much he learned to program and made this his profession.
    Before that he was engaged in various businesses, from selling programmable infrared receivers to starting a recreational submarine company.
    He is always looking to publicly document an answer or to make a process more efficient.
    He was never good at sports but tries to make it up in quantity by hiking, sailing, skiing, snowboarding, speed skating, dancing Zouk, squashing, and running.
    He loves participating in conversations on Hacker News, and reading Marc Andreessen's tweets (now that Marc stopped this greatly increased his productivity).

  story: |
    Marin loves to develop in Rails but has also grown an interest in operations, release and development workflows.
    When video conferencing with him you get a cat running across the room as a bonus.
    He is notorious for starting early in the morning just after breakfast and not having lunch until his workday is over.
    You would expect him to be hungry and grumpy the last few hours but as long as his internet connection is up he is always friendly and upbeat.
    He loves travelling and talking about politics. Here's a link to Marin's <a href="/handbook/engineering/readmes/marin-jankovski/">README</a>.

    watch a nice movie and go for a long walk. If there is a time and opportunity
    he enjoys hiking and cycling - especially in mountains.

    Toon's interest in electronics and computers started when he was a young boy. He
    learned how to solder using broken circuit boards his father replaced while
    repairing televisions. And when his parents got their first computer, he learned
    MS-DOS and started programming by typing over BASIC programs from
    magazines. Over the years the interest in computer kept growing.
    Most of the time Toon lives inside Emacs typing on one of his
    mechanical ergonomic keyboards, which he might have soldered himself.

  remote_story: |
    When I decided I wanted to move from Switzerland back home to the Czech Republic I found out that going to an office every day is problematic.
    I still wanted to spend weeks, maybe even months, in Switzerland and I definitely didn't want to take a vacation for that. At that time
    I found one of many benefits of remote work. It was back in 2016, since then I realized there is much more to this.
    And this is true especially at GitLab.
    Working for GitLab as a family-first company allows me to work while raising a small kid and still find time for plenty of my hobbies.
    I make use of the flexibility GitLab offers. I can travel and don't need to take a vacation for it,
    I can do sport or hike in beautiful mountains in the morning and work in the afternoon or late evenings.
    It also helps me to keep healthy relationships as I can meet friends for lunch or spend a day with my parents while working.
    Working remotely at GitLab simply supports me in leading a fulfilling life.

    electrical engineering at university he went on to become an devops lead at a startup,
    academia, and then a big company. Eventually deciding to spend time in Europe, he is now
    living in Slovenia where he continues to travel and enjoy the many wonderful things the city of
    Ljubljana has to offer. In addition to having fun working at Gitlab, John enjoys hacking on tiny
    electronics and playing with the latest languages and frameworks.
    When he isn't working in front of screen he is spending his free time teaching people to dance,
    learning Slovenian and noodling on his guitar.

    Alessio received his first computer when he was 8yrs old, nobody in his family knew
    how to use it but Alessio looked so happy with his new toy.
    Time passed and Alessio's room started to look more like a lab than a proper child room.
    Lots of his adolescence nights were spent coding and playing online games.
    After the university he worked as a software engineer but he always had production
    engineering tasks also.
    If not on a computer you may find him with his family, playing some board games or
    trying to fix gardening problems in his backyard.

    GitLab successful at doing remote-only. I''ve been here for 2 years now and I

  remote_story: 'I started my design career as a freelancer working remotely with
    companies worldwide but I had always wanted to work in a full-time, on-site design
    position. I assumed that collaboration would be better and communication with
    other team members easier—two things that greatly impact a designer’s ability
    to do meaningful work. After moving abroad and spending 6 years working on-site
    in Germany and London, I realised that my assumption was wrong. Just because people
    are co-located, it doesn’t necessarily mean they work together better. In fact,
    the opposite is often the case. So I decided to go back to working remotely and
    joined GitLab. Unlike before, I now have more control over my day-to-day life,
    my working environment, and a better work-life balance. GitLab being all-remote
    means we all put extra effort into communicating well which leads to better collaboration.
    In my private life, I have more energy and time to spend with my wife, our cat,
    run my own business on the side, and practice my hobbies. I can’t imagine anything
    better than that!

  remote_story: |
    Working with other GitLab team-members around the
    world asynchronously means that I can schedule my work around
    family time, which I truly appreciate.

    Having previously worked one day a week from home, I knew the benefits
    in terms of productivity and flexibility which is crucial to enable me
    to contribute to my family life with young children. Going fully remote with GitLab
    has meant that I am able to send and pick up my kids from school every weekday, thus relieving the stress
    of rushing home and not having enough hours of the day. I am then able to split my day and
    work later in the evenings which is also my usual productive times. Thanks !

    I live offgrid in a rural valley and have worked remotely as a contractor for over 15 years. Many companies allow remote situations
    but the heart and soul of the company is still in an office and remote folks miss out on "meatspace" conversations and social events.
    Even for an all-remote company, GitLab does it well - leveraging appropriate technologies and good process to ensure as much as possible is
    accessible to everyone, no matter their location or time zone. Personally, I'm grateful to be able to homeschool my children,
    tend to my 94 fruit trees, and pursue my hobbies... and still get heaps of work done in a richly connected social environment.

  remote_story: 'GitLab''s values make working remotely amazingly effective.  Having
    previously worked remotely at a different company for a number of years, I have
    experienced both the good and the bad.  What works quite well includes highly
    encouraging video during meetings, recording meetings and writing extensive notes
    for those who cannot attend live, a daily company meeting for announcements/kudos,
    a daily group social breakout meeting, distributing documents in advance of discussions
    so attendees can be prepared and informed, and most importantly asynchronous communication
    (written discussions in GitLab issues, discussions in docs, Slack, etc). are key.  Plus,
    I love to brag to my friends in Atlanta about my 15-second commute from bedroom
    to office vs. their 60+ minute commute.

  remote_story: |
    Except for two 3-year stints, my professional career has involved remote work in one way or another.
    Initially at an offshore office and more recently with 100% distributed teams.
    Working on an offshore office gave me some flexibility, but I still felt as the odd one compared to the main team.
    I'd miss out on learning and development opportunities that were tailored to the main team, along with many other opportunities.
    When I moved to Switzerland in 2012 I chose a quiet countryside city where there was basically a single big employer.
    After a while I started realizing that this choice was limiting my growth, as well as the kind of coworkers that I got to work with.
    Fortunately, in 2014, shortly after buying a lifetime subscription for a personal media streaming service called Plex,
    I received a newsletter in which Plex asked for software developers, without any restriction on location,
    and 2 weeks later I was moonlighting with them.
    The fact that my previous employer could no longer use the lack of other opportunities in the region as leverage to
    underpay and to not recognize its workers was a breath of fresh air for me, and it was clear I would likely never work
    co-located again. There are just so many advantages to remote work for me that the alternative is not even something I want to consider.

  remote_story: 'Everything about remote work is more streamlined, modern and accessible
    than traditional work. Even applying for remote roles these days is far easier
    and more productive! Working remotely allows me to focus more on my work without
    outside distractions in a zen-like trance where productivity just flows simply
    and easily. I like to walk a lot so working remote gives me opportunities to walk
    during my breaks or before work, sometimes even taking a long walk to somewhere
    peaceful before clocking in for the day.

  story: Justin's idea of a good time is solving gnarly IT problems and getting customers
    up and running again as quickly as possible. Having supported New Zealand based
    clients in his previous roles he is excited to be able to work with GitLab customers
    around the world. In his spare time Justin enjoys taking his dog for a walk, cooking
    and singing (not well) in a choir.
