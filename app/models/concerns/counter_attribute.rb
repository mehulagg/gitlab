# frozen_string_literal: true

# Add capabilities to increment a numeric model attribute efficiently by
# using CQRS. When an attribute is incremented by a value, the increment
# is logged to a separate events table. When reading the attribute we can
# choose whether to:
# 1. Read the value persisted in the database. This is faster but less
#    accurate because it can take up to ConsolidateCountersWorker::DELAY
#    to be updated. Use this unless high accuracy is required.
#
# @example
#   project_statistics.commit_count
#
# 2. Read the value persisted in the database including logged events.
#    This is more accurate but slower to compute because it includes the
#    sum of the logged events.
#
# @example
#   project_statistics.accurate_commit_count
#
# Periodically, we consolidate the logged events into the origin attribute
# and delete them from the associcate events table.
#
# In order to use this module you need to ensure that an associate events
# table exists: E.g given a model/table
#  project_statistics (
#    project_id (reference),
#    namespace_id (reference),
#    commit_count (bigint),
#    storage_size (bigint),
#    ...
#  )
# To make `commit_count` and `storage_size` as counter attributes we need
# to ensure that an events table exists with the following schema:
#  project_statistics_events (
#    project_statistics_id (reference)
#    commit_count (bigint),
#    storage_size (bigint),
#    created_at (datetime)
#  )
#
# Note that only the primary key (project_statistics_id) and the counter
# attributes are needed for the events table. Other attributes (e.g.
# project_id) are not needed.
#
# Finally, we can enable the counter behavior:
#   class ProjectStatistics
#     counter_attribute :commit_count
#     counter_attribute :storage_size
#   end
#
# To increment the counter we can use the method:
#   increment_counter(:commit_count, 3)
#
