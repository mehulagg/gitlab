| Usage                 | Guidance |
|-----------------------|----------|
| above                 | Try to avoid extra words when referring to an example or table in a documentation page, but if required, use **previously** instead. |
| admin, admin area     | Use **administration**, **administrator**, **administer**, or **Admin Area** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`Admin.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/Admin.yml)) |
| allow, enable         | Try to avoid, unless you are talking about security-related features. For example, instead of "This feature allows you to create a pipeline," use "Use this feature to create a pipeline." This phrasing is more active and is from the user perspective, rather than the person who implemented the feature. [View details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/a/allow-allows). |
| and/or                | Use **or** instead, or another sensible construction. |
| below                 | Try to avoid extra words when referring to an example or table in a documentation page, but if required, use **following** instead. |
| currently             | Do not use when talking about the product or its features. The documentation describes the product as it is today. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`CurrentStatus.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/CurrentStatus.yml)) |
| easily                | Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust. |
| e.g.                  | Do not use Latin abbreviations. Use **for example**, **such as**, **for instance**, or **like** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`LatinTerms.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/LatinTerms.yml)) |
| future tense          | When possible, use present tense instead. For example, use `after you execute this command, GitLab displays the result` instead of `after you execute this command, GitLab will display the result`. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`FutureTense.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/FutureTense.yml)) |
| handy                 | Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust. |
| high availability, HA | Do not use. Instead, direct readers to the GitLab [reference architectures](../../../administration/reference_architectures/index.md) for information about configuring GitLab for handling greater amounts of users. |
| I                     | Do not use first-person singular. Use **you**, **we**, or **us** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`FirstPerson.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/FirstPerson.yml)) |
| i.e.                  | Do not use Latin abbreviations. Use **that is** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`LatinTerms.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/LatinTerms.yml)) |
| jargon                | Do not use. Define the term or link to a definition. |
| may, might            | **Might** means something has the probability of occurring. **May** gives permission to do something. Consider **can** instead of **may**. |
| me, myself, mine      | Do not use first-person singular. Use **you**, **we**, or **us** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`FirstPerson.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/FirstPerson.yml)) |
| permissions           | Do not use roles and permissions interchangeably. Each user is assigned a role. Each role includes a set of permissions. |
| please                | Do not use. For details, see the [Microsoft style guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/p/please). |
| profanity             | Do not use. Doing so may negatively affect other users and contributors, which is contrary to the GitLab value of [Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion). |
| roles                 | Do not use roles and permissions interchangeably. Each user is assigned a role. Each role includes a set of permissions. |
| scalability           | Do not use when talking about increasing GitLab performance for additional users. The words scale or scaling are sometimes acceptable, but references to increasing GitLab performance for additional users should direct readers to the GitLab [reference architectures](../../../administration/reference_architectures/index.md) page. |
| simply                | Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust. |
| slashes               | Instead of **and/or**, use **or** or another sensible construction. This rule also applies to other slashes, like **follow/unfollow**. Some exceptions (like **CI/CD**) are allowed. |
| subgroup              | Use instead of `sub-group`. |
| that                  | Do not use. Example: `the file that you save` can be `the file you save`. |
| useful                | Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust. |
| utilize               | Do not use. Use **use** instead. It's more succinct and easier for non-native English speakers to understand. |
| via                   | Do not use Latin abbreviations. Use **with**, **through**, or **by using** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`LatinTerms.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/LatinTerms.yml)) |
