# Run the Kubernetes Agent locally **(PREMIUM ONLY)**

You can run `kas` and `agentk` locally to test the [Kubernetes Agent](index.md) yourself.

1. Create a `cfg.yaml` file from the contents of
   [`config_example.yaml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/blob/master/pkg/kascfg/config_example.yaml), or this example:

   ```yaml
   agent:
    listen:
       network: tcp
       address: 127.0.0.1:8150
       websocket: false
     gitops:
       poll_period: "10s"
   gitlab:
     address: http://localhost:3000
     authentication_secret_file: /Users/tkuah/code/ee-gdk/gitlab/.gitlab_kas_secret
   ```

1. Create a `token.txt`. This is the token for
   [the agent you created](../../user/clusters/agent/index.md#create-an-agent-record-in-gitlab). This file must not contain a newline character. You can create the file with this command:

   ```shell
   echo -n "<TOKEN>" > token.txt
   ```

1. Start the binaries with the following commands:

   ```shell
   # Need GitLab to start
   gdk start
   # Stop GDK's version of kas
   gdk stop gitlab-k8s-agent

   # Start kas
   bazel run //cmd/kas -- --configuration-file="$(pwd)/cfg.yaml"
   ```

1. In a new terminal window, run this command to start `agentk`:

   ```shell
   bazel run //cmd/agentk -- --kas-address=grpc://127.0.0.1:8150 --token-file="$(pwd)/token.txt"
   ```

You can also inspect the
[Makefile](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent/-/blob/master/Makefile)
for more targets.

## Running tests locally

### To run all the tests

```shel
make test
```

### To run all test targets in the directory

```shell
bazel test //internal/module/gitops/server:all
```

One can also use '*' instead of 'all', but then it must be quoted to avoid shell expansion

```shell
bazel test '//internal/module/gitops/server:*'
```

### To run all tests in a directory and nested directories too

```shell
bazel test //internal/module/gitops/server/...
```

### To run specific test scenarios

Take the directory and the target name of the test you're interested in, then run it with Bazel. E.g.:

To run the tests that live at `internal/module/gitops/server/module_test.go`, the `BUILD.bazel` file that defines the test's target name lives at `internal/module/gitops/server/BUILD.bazel`. In the latter, you'll see the target name defined like:

```bazel
go_test(
    name = "server_test",
    size = "small",
    srcs = [
        "module_test.go",
```

Now you know the target name is `server_test` and the directory is `internal/module/gitops/server/`. Run the test scenario with:

```shell
bazel test //internal/module/gitops/server:server_test
```
