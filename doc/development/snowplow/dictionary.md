# Event Dictionary

This file is autogenerated, please do not edit directly.

To generate these files from the GitLab repository, run:

```shell
bundle exec rake gitlab:snowplow:generate_event_dictionary
```

The Event Dictionary is based on the following event definition YAML files:

- [`config/events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/events)
- [`ee/config/events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/config/events)

Each table includes a `milestone`, which corresponds to the GitLab version when the event
was released.
