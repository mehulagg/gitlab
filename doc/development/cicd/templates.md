# Development guide for GitLab CI/CD templates

This document explains how to develop [GitLab CI/CD templates](../../ci/examples/README.md).

## Place the template file in a relevant directory

All template files reside in the `lib/gitlab/ci/templates` directory, and are categorized by the following sub-directories:

| Sub-directory | Content                                                      | [Selectable in UI](#make-sure-the-new-template-can-be-selected-in-ui) |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/AWS/*`      | Cloud Deployment (AWS) related jobs                          | No                                                                    |
| `/Jobs/*`     | Auto DevOps related jobs                                     | Yes                                                                   |
| `/Pages/*`    | Static site generators for GitLab Pages (for example Jekyll) | Yes                                                                   |
| `/Security/*` | Security related jobs                                        | Yes                                                                   |
| `/Verify/*`   | Verify/testing related jobs                                  | Yes                                                                   |
| `/Worklows/*` | Common uses of the `workflow:` keyword                       | No                                                                    |
| `/*` (root)   | General templates                                            | Yes                                                                   |

## Criteria

The file must follow the [`.gitlab-ci.yml` syntax](../../ci/yaml/README.md).
Verify it's valid by pasting it into the CI lint tool at `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/ci/lint`.

Also, all templates must be named with the `*.gitlab-ci.yml` suffix.

### Backward compatibility

A template might be dynamically included with the `include:template:` keyword. If
you make a change to an *existing* template, you **must** make sure that it won't break
CI/CD in existing projects.

For example, changing a job name in a template could break pipelines in an existing project.
Let's say there is a template named `Performance.gitlab-ci.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
performance:
  image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/verify-tools/performance:v0.1.0
  script: ./performance-test $TARGET_URL
```

and users include this template with passing an argument to the `performance` job.
This can be done by specifying the environment variable `TARGET_URL` in _their_ `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  template: Performance.gitlab-ci.yml

performance:
  variables:
    TARGET_URL: https://awesome-app.com
```

If the job name `performance` in the template is renamed to `browser-performance`,
user's `.gitlab-ci.yml` will immediately cause a lint error because there
are no such jobs named `performance` in the included template anymore. Therefore,
users have to fix their `.gitlab-ci.yml` that could annoy their workflow.

Please read [versioning](#versioning) section for introducing breaking change safely.

## Testing

Each CI/CD template must be tested in order to make sure that it's safe to be published.

### Manual QA

It's always good practice to test the template in a minimal demo project.
To do so, please follow the following steps:

1. Create a public sample project on <https://gitlab.com>.
1. Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` to the project with the proposed template.
1. Run pipelines and make sure that everything runs properly, in all possible cases
   (merge request pipelines, schedules, and so on).
1. Link to the project in the description of the merge request that is adding a new template.

This is useful information for reviewers to make sure the template is safe to be merged.

### Make sure the new template can be selected in UI

Templates located under some directories are also [selectable in the **New file** UI](#place-the-template-file-in-a-relevant-directory).
When you add a template into one of those directories, make sure that it correctly appears in the dropdown:

![CI/CD template selection](img/ci_template_selection_v13_1.png)

### Write an RSpec test

You should write an RSpec test to make sure that pipeline jobs will be generated correctly:

1. Add a test file at `spec/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/<template-category>/<template-name>_spec.rb`
1. Test that pipeline jobs are properly created via `Ci::CreatePipelineService`.

## Security

A template could contain malicious code. For example, a template that contains the `export` shell command in a job
might accidentally expose project secret variables in a job log.
If you're unsure if it's secure or not, you need to ask security experts for cross-validation.

## Versioning

Versioning allows you to introduce a new template without modifying the existing
one. This is useful process especially when we need to introduce a breaking change,
but don't want to affect the existing projects that depends on the current template.

There is an [open issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17716) for
introducing versioning concept in GitLab Ci Template. Please follow the issue for
checking the progress.
