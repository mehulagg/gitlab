# Avoid Entity Attribute Value Model (EAV)

This pattern is a well-known anti-pattern called [entity-attribute-value or EAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model). While this used to be the sometimes "necessary evil" many years ago, there are better options today - in PostgreSQL that's `jsonb` and `hstore`. Both lend itself to store unstructured data. However, we only consider this a viable solution if we must store unstructured data and don't know upfront what information to expect. If we know what attributes we are going to see, a solid table with normal columns is the best thing to start with (`NULL` values cost next to nothing in terms of space).
