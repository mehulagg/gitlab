# GitLab Token overview

This document lists tokens used in GitLab, their purpose and, where applicable, security guidance.

## [Personal access token](../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md)

You can create Personal access tokens to authenticate with the GitLab API, repositories and the GitLab registry. You can also use personal access tokens with Git to authenticate over HTTP(S).

Personal access tokens can be limited in scope and expiration time. They inherit their permissions from the user that created them.

Personal access tokens can be centrally managed via the [Credentials inventory](../user/admin_area/credentials_inventory.md).


## [OAuth2 token](../api/oauth2.md)

GitLab can serve as an OAuth2 provider to allow other services to access the GitLab API on a user’s behalf. Services can use a [variety of OAuth2 flows](../api/oauth2.md#supported-oauth2-flows) to request [OAuth2 tokens](../api/oauth2.md#access-gitlab-api-with-access-token).

OAuth2 tokens can be limited in scope and expiration time. They inherit their permissions from the user that granted them.

## [Impersonation token](../api/README.md#impersonation-tokens)

Impersonation tokens are a type of personal access token that can be created only by an administrator for a specific user. They can be useful if you want to build applications or scripts that authenticate with the GitLab API, repositories and the GitLab registry as a specific user.

Impersonation tokens can be limited in scope and expiration time. They inherit their permissions from the user they were created for.

## [Project access token](../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md#project-access-tokens)

Project access tokens are scoped to a project and can be used to authenticate with the GitLab API, the project repository and the GitLab registry. You can also use project access tokens with Git to authenticate over HTTP(S).

Project access tokens can be limited in scope and expiration time. When you create a project Access Token, GitLab creates a [project bot user](../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md#project-bot-users). Project bot users are service accounts and do not count as licensed seats. They have maintainer permissions on the project they were created in.

Project access tokens can be managed by project maintainers and owners.

Project access tokens can be centrally managed via the [Credentials inventory](../user/admin_area/credentials_inventory.md).

## [Deploy Token](../user/project/deploy_tokens/index.md)

Deploy tokens allow you to download (git clone) or push and pull packages and container registry images of a project without having a user and a password. Deploy tokens cannot be used with the GitLab API.

Deploy tokens can be managed by project maintainers and owners.

## [Deploy Keys](../user/project/deploy_keys/index.md)

Deploy keys allow read-only or read-write access to your repositories by importing an SSH public key into your GitLab instance. Deploy keys cannot be used with the GitLab API or the registry.

This is useful, for example, for cloning repositories to your Continuous Integration (CI) server. By using deploy keys, you don’t have to set up a fake user account.

Project maintainers and owners can add or enable a deploy key for a project repository

## Runner registration token

Runner registration tokens are used to [register](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) a [runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) with GitLab. Group or project owners or instance admins can obtain them through GitLab interfaces. The registration token is limited to runner registration and has no further scope.

Because it can be used to add new runners that may execute jobs in a project or group and thus have access to the project’s code, careful consideration should be given as to who has project or group owner-level permissions.

We are [actively working on security improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/25351) to the runner API.

## Runner authentication token (also called runner token)

After registration, the runner will receive an authentication token used to authenticate with GitLab when picking up jobs from the job queue. The authentication token is stored locally in the Runner's [config.toml](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html) file.

After authentication with GitLab, the Runner will receive a [job token](../user/project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.md#job-token) to execute the job.

In case of Docker Machine/Kubernetes/VirtualBox/Parallels/SSH executors, the execution environment has no access to the runner authentication token as it stays on the runner machine. They have only access to the job token, which is needed to execute the job.

Malicious access to a runner's file system may expose the config.toml file and thus the authentication token, allowing an attacker to [clone the runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/security/#cloning-a-runner).

## [Job Token](../user/project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.md#job-token)

The job token is a short lived token only valid for the duration of the job. It is able to access a limited amount of [APIs](../api/README.md#gitlab-ci-job-token). The job token is used for authentication, while authorization is provided by the user triggering the job.

The job token is secured by its short life-time and limited scope. It could possibly be leaked if multiple jobs run on the same machine ([like with the shell runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/security/#usage-of-shell-executor)). On Docker Machine runners, configuring [`MaxBuilds=1`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#the-runnersmachine-section) is recommended to make sure runner machines only ever run one build and are destroyed afterwards. This may impact performance, as provisioning machines takes some time.

# Available scopes
This table shows available scopes per token. Scopes can be limited further on token creation.
