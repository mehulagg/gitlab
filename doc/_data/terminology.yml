# data file to (somehow) call from tooltips or popovers

gitlab:
  namespace: |
    Either a **user name** or a **group name**.

git:
  repository: |
    Where your files live. Often referred by "repo".
  remote_repository: |
    Where your files live in GitLab. In your computer it's called **local** repository.
  fork: |
    When you want to copy someone else's repository, you **fork**
    the project. By forking it, you'll create a copy of the project into your own
    namespace to have read and write permissions to modify the project files
    and settings.
  clone: |
    To create a copy of a remote repository files in your computer, you can either
    **download** or **clone** it. If you download it, you cannot sync it with the
    remote repository on GitLab.

    By cloning a repository, you'll download a copy of its files to your local
    computer, but preserve the Git connection with the remote repository so you
    can work on the its files in your computer and then "upload" the changes to
    GitLab.
  push: |
    From a local repository, "upload" the changes to GitLab, in analogy to the
    command `git push`.
  pull: |
    Update your local repository with the changes in the remote repository,
    in analogy to the command `git pull`.
