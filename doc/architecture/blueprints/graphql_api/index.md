# GraphQL API

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open-source data query and manipulation
language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.

At GitLab we want to adopt GrapQL to make it easier for the wider community to
interact with GitLab in a reliable way, but to also advance our own engineering
culture by modeling communicaton between backend and frontend components using
GraphQL.

This document describes the foundational work that is required to evolve our
[GraphQL API](#link-to-graphql-docs) in a way that it is suitable for a
large-scale production usage.

## Summary

The GraphQL initiative [started around three years ago](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/9c6c17cbcdb8bf8185fc1b873dcfd08f723e4df5).
Most of the work around the GraphQL ecosystem is done by volunteers that are
[GraphQL experts](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/graphql-experts/-/group_members?with_inherited_permissions=exclude),
one of whom [raised concerns](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235659) about how the
work is approached and structured. This blueprint describes a plan to address
these concerns
