# Image resizing for avatars and content images

Currently, we are showing all uploaded images 1:1, which is of course not ideal. To improve performance greatly we will add image resizing to the backend. There are two main areas of image resizing to consider; avatars and content images.  The MVC for this implementation will focus on Avatars.  Avatars requests consist of approximately 70% of total image requests.  Their sizes are limited and the scope for resizing them is limited as well.  Content image resizing has many more considerations for size and features.  It is entirely possible that we have two separate development efforts with the same goal of increasing performance via image resizing.

## MVC Avatar Resizing

We will implement a dynamic image resizing solution. This means image should be resized and optimized on the fly so that if we define new targeted sizes later we can add them on the fly. If an image is resized and optimized then we need to cache it. The initial approach is a query string based approach. This would mean a huge improvement in performance as some of the measurements suggest that we can save up to 95% of our current load size. As soon as we have this base implementation on the backend this gives on the Frontend huge potential to save a lot of performance.

## Content Image Resizing

Content image resizing is a more complex problem to tackle.  There are no set size restrictions and there are additional features or requirements to consider.

- Dynamic WebP support
- Extract first image of GIF's so we can prevent from loading 10MB pixels
- Check Device Pixel Ratio to deliver nice images on High DPI screens
- Blurring
- Resizing recommendations (size, clarity, etc.)
- Storage

The MVC Avatar resizing implementation is integrated into Workhorse.  With the extra requirements for content image resizing, this may require further use of GraphicsMagik (GM) or a similar library and breaking it out of Workhorse.
