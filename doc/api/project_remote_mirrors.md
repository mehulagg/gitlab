# Project remote mirrors API

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/54574) in GitLab 11.8

A project's remote mirrors are its push mirrors. Remote mirrors are not pull mirrors.

There is
[an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/51763)
to improve the naming of push and pull mirrors.
