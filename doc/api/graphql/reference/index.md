# GraphQL API Resources

This documentation is self-generated based on GitLab current GraphQL schema.

The API can be explored interactively using the [GraphiQL IDE](../index.md#graphiql).

Each table below documents a GraphQL type. Types match loosely to models, but not all
fields and methods on a model are available via GraphQL.

WARNING:
Fields that are deprecated are marked with **{warning-solid}**.
Items (fields, enums, etc) that have been removed according to our [deprecation process](../index.md#deprecation-and-removal-process) can be found
in [Removed Items](../removed_items.md).

## Scalar Types

Scalar values are simple atomic values, and do not have fields of their own.
Basic scalars include strings, boolean values and numbers, but this schema also
defines some custom scalar values.

This schema uses custom scalar types for identifiers, with a specific type for
each kind of object.

For more information, read about [Scalar Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) on `graphql.org`.
