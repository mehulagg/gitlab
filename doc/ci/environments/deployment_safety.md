# Deployment safety
 
Deployment jobs can be more sensitive than other jobs in a pipeline,
and might need to be treated with extra care. GitLab has several features
that help maintain deployment security and stability.
 
You can:
 
- [Restrict write-access to a critical environment](#restrict-write-access-to-a-critical-environment)
- [Prevent deployments during deploy freeze windows](#prevent-deployments-during-deploy-freeze-windows)
- [Set appropriate roles to your project](#setting-appropriate-roles-to-your-project)
- [Protect production secrets](#protect-production-secrets)
- [Seperate project for deployments](#seperate-project-for-deployments)
 
If you are using a continuous deployment workflow and want to ensure that concurrent deployments to the same environment do not happen, you should enable the following options:
 
- [Ensure only one deployment job runs at a time](#ensure-only-one-deployment-job-runs-at-a-time)
- [Skip outdated deployment jobs](#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs)
 
## Restrict write access to a critical environment
 
By default, environments can be modified by any team member that has [Developer permission or higher](../../user/permissions.md#project-members-permissions).
If you want to restrict write access to a critical environment (for example a `production` environment),
you can set up [protected environments](protected_environments.md).
 
## Ensure only one deployment job runs at a time
 
Pipeline jobs in GitLab CI/CD run in parallel, so it's possible that two deployment
jobs in two different pipelines attempt to deploy to the same environment at the same
time. This is not desired behavior as deployments should happen sequentially.
 
You can ensure only one deployment job runs at a time with the [`resource_group` keyword](../yaml/README.md#resource_group) in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
 
For example:
 
```yaml
deploy:
 script: deploy-to-prod
 resource_group: prod
```
 
Example of a problematic pipeline flow **before** using the resource group:
 
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-A starts running.
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-B starts running. *This is a concurrent deployment that could cause an unexpected result.*
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-A finished.
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-B finished.
 
The improved pipeline flow **after** using the resource group:
 
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-A starts running.
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-B attempts to start, but waits for the first `deploy` job to finish.
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-A finishes.
1. `deploy` job in Pipeline-B starts running.
 
For more information, see [`resource_group` keyword in `.gitlab-ci.yml`](../yaml/README.md#resource_group).
 
## Skip outdated deployment jobs
 
The execution order of pipeline jobs can vary from run to run, which could cause
undesired behavior. For example, a deployment job in a newer pipeline could
finish before a deployment job in an older pipeline.
This creates a race condition where the older deployment finished later,
overwriting the "newer" deployment.
 
You can ensure that older deployment jobs are cancelled automatically when a newer deployment
runs by enabling the [Skip outdated deployment jobs](../pipelines/settings.md#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs) feature.
 
Example of a problematic pipeline flow **before** enabling Skip outdated deployment jobs:
 
1. Pipeline-A is created on the `master` branch.
1. Later, Pipeline-B is created on the `master` branch (with a newer commit SHA).
1. The `deploy` job in Pipeline-B finishes first, and deploys the newer code.
1. The `deploy` job in Pipeline-A finished later, and deploys the older code, **overwriting** the newer (latest) deployment.
 
The improved pipeline flow **after** enabling Skip outdated deployment jobs:
 
1. Pipeline-A is created on the `master` branch.
1. Later, Pipeline-B is created on the `master` branch (with a newer SHA).
1. The `deploy` job in Pipeline-B finishes first, and deploys the newer code.
1. The `deploy` job in Pipeline-A is automatically cancelled, so that it doesn't overwrite the deployment from the newer pipeline.
 
## Prevent deployments during deploy freeze windows
 
If you want to prevent deployments for a particular period, for example during a planned
vacation period when most employees are out, you can set up a [Deploy Freeze](../../user/project/releases/index.md#prevent-unintentional-releases-by-setting-a-deploy-freeze).
During a deploy freeze period, no deployment can be executed. This is helpful to
ensure that deployments do not happen unexpectedly.
 
 
## Setting appropriate roles to your project
 
1. Gitlab supports several different [roles](../../user/permissions.md#group-members-permissions) that can be assigned to your project members
 1. Guest - Has the lowest level of permissions
 1. Reporter
 1. Developer
 1. Maintainer - includes project settings (including protected configurations) - has access to production environment
 1. Owner - Highest level of permissions - Full access to all project features

## Protect production secrets
 
Production secrets are needed in order to deploy successfully. For example when deploying to the cloud, cloud providers require these secrets in order to connect to their services. Environment variables can be used and can be defined under the project settings and they can also be protected. [Protected Variables](../variables.md#protect-a-custom-variable)  are only passed to pipelines running on [protected branches](../../user/project/protected_branches.md) or [protected tags](../../user/project/protected_tags.md). The other pipelines do not get the protected variable.
Variables can also be [scoped to specific environments](../variables/where_variables_can_be_used.md#variables-with-an-environment-scope). It is recommended to use protected variables on protected environments to make sure that the secrets are not exposed to an unintentional environment.  Production secrets can also be defined on the [runner side](../runners.md/#prevent-runners-from-revealing-sensitive-information) this prevents other maintainers from reading the secrets and makes sure that the runner runs only on protected branches.
 
For more information, see [pipeline security](../pipelines.md#pipeline-security-on-protected-branches).
 
## Seperate project for deployments
 
All maintainers of a project have access to production secrets. In case there is a need to limit the number of users that are deploying to a production environment, another way to achieve this is to create a seperate project where you can configure a new permission model where you can isolate the CD permissions from the original project and prevent maintainers from that project to access production secret and CD configuration. You can connect the CD project to your development projects by using [multi-project pipelines](../multi_project_pipelines.md).

## Protect `gitlab-ci.yml` from changing by developers

A `.gitlab-ci.yml` may contain rules to deploy application to production server and (ususally) runs automaticaly after pushing a merge request. In case you want to prevent developers from changing the `gitlab-ci.yml`, you can define the `.gitlab-ci.yml` in a different repository. The configuration can reference a file in another project with a completely different set of permissions (similar to [what was discussed under seperating project for deployments](#seperate-project-for-deployments)). The file will be publicly accessible, but can only be edited by users with appropriate permissions in the other project.

For more information, see [Custom CI configuration path](../pipelines/settings.html#custom-ci-configuration-path).

## Troubleshooting
 
### Pipelines jobs fail with `The deployment job is older than the previously succeeded deployment job...`
 
This is caused by the [Skip outdated deployment jobs](../pipelines/settings.md#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs) feature.
If you have multiple jobs for the same environment (including non-deployment jobs), you might encounter this problem, for example:
 
```yaml
build:service-a:
 environment:
   name: production
 
build:service-b:
 environment:
   name: production
```
 
The [Skip outdated deployment jobs](../pipelines/settings.md#skip-outdated-deployment-jobs) might
not work well with this configuration, and must be disabled.
