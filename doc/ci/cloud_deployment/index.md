# Cloud deployment

Interacting with a major cloud provider may have become a much needed task that's
part of your delivery process. GitLab is making this process less painful by providing Docker images
that come with the needed libraries and tools pre-installed.
By referencing them in your CI/CD pipeline, you'll be able to interact with your chosen
cloud provider more easily.

## AWS

GitLab provides Docker images that you can use to [run AWS commands from GitLab CI/CD](#run-aws-commands-from-gitlab-cicd), and a template to make
it easier to [deploy to AWS](#deploy-your-application-to-the-aws-elastic-container-service-ecs).

### Run AWS commands from GitLab CI/CD

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/31167) in GitLab 12.6.

GitLab's AWS Docker image provides the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/),
which enables you to run `aws` commands. As part of your deployment strategy, you can run `aws` commands directly from
`.gitlab-ci.yml` by specifying [GitLab's AWS Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy).

Some credentials are required to be able to run `aws` commands:

1. Sign up for [an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-set-up.html) if you don't have one yet.
1. Log in onto the console and create [a new IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home).
1. Select your newly created user to access its details. Navigate to **Security credentials > Create a new access key**.

   NOTE: **Note:**
   A new **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** pair will be generated. Please take a note of them right away.

1. In your GitLab project, go to **Settings > CI / CD**. Set the following as
   [environment variables](../variables/README.md#gitlab-cicd-environment-variables)
   (see table below):

   - Access key ID.
   - Secret access key.
   - Region code. You can check the [list of AWS regional endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints).
     You might want to check if the AWS service you intend to use is
     [available in the chosen region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).

   | Env. variable name      | Value                  |
   |:------------------------|:-----------------------|
   | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | Your Access key ID     |
   | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your Secret access key |
   | `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`    | Your region code       |

1. You can now use `aws` commands in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file of this project:

   ```yaml
   deploy:
     stage: deploy
     image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/aws-base:latest # see the note below
     script:
       - aws s3 ...
       - aws create-deployment ...
   ```

   NOTE: **Note:**
   The image used in the example above
   (`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/aws-base:latest`) is hosted on the [GitLab
   Container Registry](../../user/packages/container_registry/index.md) and is
   ready to use. Alternatively, replace the image with one hosted on AWS ECR.

### Use an AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) image in your CI/CD

Instead of referencing an image hosted on the GitLab Registry, you can
reference an image hosted on any third-party registry, such as the
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).

To do so, [push your image into your ECR
repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html).
Then reference it in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and replace the `image`
path to point to your ECR image.

### Deploy your application to the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207962) in GitLab 12.9.
> - The `Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml` template was deprecated in favor of `AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml` template in GitLab 13.2.

GitLab provides a series of [CI templates that you can include in your project](../yaml/README.md#include).
To automate deployments of your application to your [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (AWS ECS)
cluster, you can `include` the `AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml` template in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

GitLab also provides [Docker images](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/-/tree/master/aws) that can be used in your `gitlab-ci.yml` file to simplify working with AWS:

- Use `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/aws-base:latest` to use AWS CLI commands.
- Use `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/aws-ecs:latest` to deploy your application to AWS ECS.

Before getting started with this process, you need a cluster on AWS ECS, as well as related
components, like an ECS service, ECS task definition, a database on AWS RDS, etc.
[Read more about AWS ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).

After you're all set up on AWS ECS, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your AWS credentials are set up as environment variables for your
   project. You can follow [the steps above](#run-aws-commands-from-gitlab-cicd) to complete this setup.
1. Add these variables to your project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   variables:
     CI_AWS_ECS_CLUSTER: my-cluster
     CI_AWS_ECS_SERVICE: my-service
     CI_AWS_ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: my-task-definition
   ```

   Three variables are defined in this snippet:

   - `CI_AWS_ECS_CLUSTER`: The name of your AWS ECS cluster that you're
   targeting for your deployments.
   - `CI_AWS_ECS_SERVICE`: The name of the targeted service tied to
   your AWS ECS cluster.
   - `CI_AWS_ECS_TASK_DEFINITION`: The name of the task definition tied
   to the service mentioned above.

   You can find these names after selecting the targeted cluster on your [AWS ECS dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home):

   ![AWS ECS dashboard](../img/ecs_dashboard_v12_9.png)

1. Include this template in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

   ```yaml
   include:
     - template: AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml
   ```

   The `AWS/Deploy-ECS` template ships with GitLab and is available [on
   GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml).

1. Commit and push your updated `.gitlab-ci.yml` to your project's repository, and you're done!

   Your application Docker image will be rebuilt and pushed to the GitLab registry.
   Then the targeted task definition will be updated with the location of the new
   Docker image, and a new revision will be created in ECS as result.

   Finally, your AWS ECS service will be updated with the new revision of the
   task definition, making the cluster pull the newest version of your
   application.

CAUTION: **Warning:**
The [`AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml)
template includes both the [`Jobs/Build.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Build.gitlab-ci.yml)
and [`Jobs/Deploy/ECS.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Deploy/ECS.gitlab-ci.yml)
"sub-templates". Do not include these "sub-templates" on their own, and only include the main
`AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml` template. The "sub-templates" are designed to only be
used along with the main template. They may move or change unexpectedly causing your
pipeline to fail if you didn't include the main template. Also, the job names within
these templates may change. Do not override these jobs names in your own pipeline,
as the override will stop working when the name changes.

Alternatively, if you don't wish to use the `AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml` template
to deploy to AWS ECS, you can always use our
`aws-base` Docker image to run your own [AWS CLI commands for ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/index.html#cli-aws-ecs).

```yaml
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-deploy/aws-base:latest
  script:
    - aws ecs register-task-definition ...
```
