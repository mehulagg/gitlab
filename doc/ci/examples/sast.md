# Static Application Security Testing with GitLab CI/CD

NOTE: **Note:**
In order to use this tool, a [GitLab Ultimate][ee] license
is needed.

This example shows how to run
[Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)
on your project's source code by using GitLab CI/CD.

First, you need GitLab Runner with [docker-in-docker executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-executor).
You can then add a new job to `.gitlab-ci.yml`, called `sast`:

```yaml
before_script:
  - functions

sast:
  image: docker:latest
  variables:
    DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  allow_failure: true
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - setup_docker
    - sast
  artifacts:
    paths: [gl-sast-report.json]

.functions: &functions |
  # Variables and functions

  function setup_docker() {
    if ! docker info &>/dev/null; then
      if [ -z "$DOCKER_HOST" -a "$KUBERNETES_PORT" ]; then
        export DOCKER_HOST='tcp://localhost:2375'
      fi
    fi
  }

  function sast() {
    case "$CI_SERVER_VERSION" in
      *-ee)
        # Extract "MAJOR.MINOR" from CI_SERVER_VERSION and generate "MAJOR-MINOR-stable"
        SAST_VERSION=$(echo "$CI_SERVER_VERSION" | sed 's/^\([0-9]*\)\.\([0-9]*\).*/\1-\2-stable/')

        docker run --env SAST_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL="${SAST_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL:-3}" \
                   --env SAST_DISABLE_REMOTE_CHECKS="${SAST_DISABLE_REMOTE_CHECKS:-false}" \
                   --volume "$PWD:/code" \
                   --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                   "registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast:$SAST_VERSION" /app/bin/run /code
        ;;
      *)
        echo "GitLab Enterprise Edition is required"
        ;;
    esac
  }
```

The above example will create a `sast` job in your CI pipeline and will allow
you to download and analyze the report artifact in JSON format. Check the
[Auto-DevOps template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-yml/blob/master/Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml)
for a full reference.

The results are sorted by the priority of the vulnerability:

1. High
1. Medium
1. Low
1. Unknown
1. Everything else

Behind the scenes, the [GitLab SAST Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast)
is used to detect the languages/frameworks and in turn runs the matching scan tools.

Some security scanners require to send a list of project dependencies to GitLab
central servers to check for vulnerabilities. To learn more about this or to
disable it, check the [GitLab SAST tool documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast#remote-checks).

TIP: **Tip:**
Starting with [GitLab Ultimate][ee] 10.3, this information will
be automatically extracted and shown right in the merge request widget. To do
so, the CI job must be named `sast` and the artifact path must be
`gl-sast-report.json`.
