# Pipeline artifacts

> - Introduced in GitLab 13.4

Pipeline artifacts are a list of files created by a job once it finishes. This feature is not enabled by default in all GitLab installations.

Pipeline artifacts are created by GitLab and uploaded to GitLab. They are being used by the [test coverage visualization feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/test_coverage_visualization.html)

## Storage

A pipeline artifacts is persisted on **disk** and will be taken into account within the project's [storage usage quota](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#storage-usage-quota).

## Artifacts size

> - Introduced in GitLab 13.5

The `Artifacts` size is now the sum of `build artifacts + pipeline artifacts`.

## Artifacts data rentention policy

NOTE: **Note:**
This could evolve in the future.

Pipeline artifacts generated by gitlab and are erased after `1 week`.
