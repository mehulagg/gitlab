# Compliance **(ULTIMATE)**

The compliance tools provided by GitLab let you keep an eye on various aspects of your project. The
following compliance tools are available:

- [License Compliance](license_compliance/index.md): Search your project's dependencies for their
  licenses. This lets you determine if the licenses of your project's dependencies are compatible
  with your project's license.
- [Pipeline compliance](pipeline_compliance/index.md): Create an isolated .yml configuration define compliance requirements
such as scans or tests, that can be enforced in individual projects through a [compliance framework](../group/compliance/compliance_frameworks/index.md).
