# Ruby gems in the Package Registry

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/803) in [GitLab Free](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.10.

Publish Ruby gems in your project’s Package Registry. Then install the
packages whenever you need to use them as a dependency.

For documentation of the specific API endpoints that the Ruby gems and Bundler package manager
clients use, see the [Ruby gems API documentation](../../../api/packages/rubygems.md).

## Enable the Ruby gems registry

The Ruby gems registry for GitLab is under development, and isn’t ready for production use due to limited functionality.
In it's current state, gems can be pushed, but not yet installed from the registry, although `.gem` files can be downloaded
directly from the UI or using the [API](../../../api/packages/rubygems.md#download-a-gem-file)

It is behind a feature flag that is disabled by default.

GitLab administrators with access to the GitLab Rails console can enable it for your instance.

To enable it:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:rubygem_packages)
```

To disable it:

```ruby
Feature.disable(:rubygem_packages)
```

To enable or disable it for specific projects:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:rubygem_packages, Project.find(1))
Feature.disable(:rubygem_packages, Project.find(2))
```

## Create a Ruby Gem

This section explains how to create a gem.

If you already use RubyGems and know how to build your own packages, go to the
[next section](#authenticate-with-the-package-registry).

### Create a project

Create a test project.

1. Open your terminal.
1. Create a directory called `my_gem`, and then go to that directory:

   ```shell
   mkdir my_gem && cd my_gem
   ```

1. Create a directory called `lib` and inside of that directory create a file named `my_gem.rb`

   ```shell
   mkdir lib
   touch lib/my_gem.rb
   ```

1. Add some contents to `my_gem.rb`:

   ```shell
   class MyGem
      def self.hello
        puts "Hello GitLab!"
      end
    end
   ```

1. Create a `.gemspec` file named `my_gem.gemspec` in the `my_gem/` directory.

   ```shell
   touch my_gem.gemspec
   ```

1. Define your gem inside of that file:

   ```ruby
   Gem::Specification.new do |s|
     s.name        = 'my_gem'
     s.version     = '0.0.1'
     s.summary     = "Hello GitLab!"
     s.description = "A simple hello world gem"
     s.authors     = ["GitLab Tanuki"]
     s.email       = 'tanuki@gitlab.com'
     s.files       = ["lib/my_gem.rb"]
     s.license     = 'MIT'
   end
   ```

See the [RubyGems specification reference](https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/)
for details on available attributes.

Now that you have a project put together with a `.gemspec` file, you are ready
to build a gem!

### Build the gem

After you create a project, you can create a gem.

1. In your terminal, go to the `my_gem` directory.

1. Build the gem from the `.gemspec` file:

   ```shell
   gem build my_gem.gemspec
   ```

The output should be visible in `my_gem` directory:

```shell
ls -1
```

You should see the newly created `.gem` file listed:

```plaintext
lib
my_gem-1.0.0.gem
my_gem.gemspec
```

The gem is now ready to be pushed to the Package Registry.

## Authenticate with the Package Registry

Before you can push to the Package Registry, you must authenticate.

To do this, you can use:

- A [personal access token](../../../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md)
  with the scope set to `api`.
- A [deploy token](../../project/deploy_tokens/index.md) with the scope set to
  `read_package_registry`, `write_package_registry`, or both.
- A [CI job token](#authenticate-with-a-ci-job-token).

### Authenticate with a personal access token or deploy token

To authenticate with a personal access token, create or edit the `~/.gem/credentials` file and add:

```ini
---
https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/rubygems: '<your token>'
```

- `<your token>` must be the token value of either your personal access token or deploy token.
- Your project ID is on your project's home page.

### Authenticate with a CI job token

To work with RubyGems commands within [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/README.md), you
can use `CI_JOB_TOKEN` instead of a personal access token or deploy token.

For example:

```yaml
image: ruby:latest

run:
  script:
```

You can also use `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in a `~/.gem/credentials` file that you check in to
GitLab:

```ini
---
https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/${env.CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/rubygems: '${env.CI_JOB_TOKEN}'
```

## Push a Ruby gem

Prerequisites:

- You must [authenticate with the Package Registry](#authenticate-with-the-package-registry).
- The maximum allowed gem size is 3 GB.

To push your gem, run a command like:

```shell
gem push my_gem-0.0.1.gem --host <host>
```

- `<host>` is the URL you used when setting up authentication, for example:

```shell
gem push my_gem-0.0.1.gem --host https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/rubygems
```

This message indicates that the gem was successfully uploaded:

```plaintext
Pushing gem to https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/rubygems...
{"message":"201 Created"}
```

To view the published gem, go to your project's **Packages & Registries**
page. When pushing gems to GitLab, they aren't displayed in the packages user
interface of your project immediately. It can take up to 10 minutes to process
a gem.

### Pushing gems with the same name or version

You can push a gem if a package of the same name and version already exists.
Both will be visible and accessible in the UI, however only the most recently
pushed gem will be used for installs.

<!-- ## Install a Ruby gem

### Using gem install

To install the latest version of a package, use the following command:

```shell
gem install my_gem --source <source>
```

- `<source>` is the URL you used when setting up authentication, for example:

```shell
gem install my_gem --source https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/rubygems
```

### Using bundler

Add the gem to your project's Gemfile:

```plaintext
source 'https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/rubygems'

gem 'my_gem'
```

Run `bundle install` from the directory containing the Gemfile:

```shell
bundle install
``` -->
