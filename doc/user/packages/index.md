# GitLab Package Registry

The GitLab Package Registry is a place for you to publish, share, and discover packages in any of the below formats.

You can use it like a private repository, where you publish images that were built with
any of the following package managers. When you store an image in the Package Registry,
it can be consumed as a dependency in downstream projects.

You can also:

- [Use one specific project to store your packages](./workflows/project_registry.md) or
- Publish multiple packages from [one monorepo project](./workflows/monorepo.md).

## Enable the Package Registry for your project

If the **{package}** **Packages > List** isn't visible on your
project's sidebar, it's not enabled in your GitLab instance. Ask your
administrator to enable the Package Registry by using the [administration
documentation](../../administration/packages/index.md).

After it's enabled for your GitLab instance, enable the Package Registry for your
project:

1. Go to your project's **{settings}** **Settings > General** page.
1. Expand the **Visibility, project features, permissions** section and enable the
**Packages** feature.
1. Click **Save changes**.

The **{package}** **Packages > List** is visible in the sidebar.

### View Packages for your project

To view all packages that have been added to your project,
go to your project's **{package}** **Packages > List**.

![Project Packages list](img/project_packages_list_v12_10.png)

On this page, you can:

- View all the packages that have been uploaded to the project.
- Sort the packages list by created date, version or name.
- Filter the list by package name.
- Change tabs to display packages of a certain type.
- Remove a package (if you have suitable [permissions](../permissions.md)).
- Navigate to specific package detail page.

### View Packages for your group

To view all packages that belong to a group, from the group sidebar,
go to **{package}** **Packages > List**.

![Group Packages list](img/group_packages_list_v12_10.png)

On this page, you can:

- View all the packages that have been uploaded to each of the groups projects.
- Sort the packages list by created date, version, name, or project.
- Filter the list by package name.
- Change tabs to display packages of a certain type.
- Navigate to specific package detail page.

### View additional package information

To view additional package information, from the either the project or group list,
go to the package details page.

![Package detail](img/package_detail_v12_10.png)

On this page you can:

- See the extended package information, including metadata. This is unique to
each package type and will display different information for different types.
- View quick installation and registry setup instructions. These are a shortcut
for users who have already set up the Package Registry and just want quick
installation instructions.
- View the package activity, including when and how a package was published.
- View and download the contents of the package. Outside of installing a
package via a manager, you can also download the files individually.
- Delete the package (if you have suitable [permissions](../permissions.md)).

### Build packages via GitLab CI/CD

Some of the supported packages can be built via [GitLab CI/CD](./../../ci/README.md)
using the `CI_JOB_TOKEN`. If a package is built this way, then extended activity
information is displayed on the package details page:

![Package CI/CD activity](img/package_activity_v12_10.png)

You can view which pipeline published the package, as well as the commit and
user who triggered it. To see if a package type supports being built via CI/CD,
check the specific documentation for your package type.
