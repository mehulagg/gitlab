# Packages & Registries

The GitLab [Package Registry](package_registry/index.md) acts as a private or public registry
for a variety of common package managers. You can publish and share
packages, which can be easily consumed as a dependency in downstream projects.

You can also use the [API](../../api/packages.md) to administer the Package Registry.

The GitLab [Container Registry](container_registry/index.md) is a secure and private registry for container images.
It's built on open source software and completely integrated within GitLab.
Use GitLab CI/CD to create and publish images. Use the GitLab [API](../../api/container_registry.md) to
manage the registry across groups and projects.

The [Dependency Proxy](dependency_proxy/index.md) is a local proxy for frequently-used upstream images and packages.
