# Iterations **(STARTER)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214713) in [GitLab Starter](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.1.
> - It's deployed behind a feature flag, disabled by default.
> - It's disabled on GitLab.com.
> - It's able to be enabled or disabled per-group
> - It's not recommended for production use.
> - To use it in GitLab self-managed instances, ask a GitLab administrator to [enable it](#enable-iterations-core-only). **(CORE ONLY)**

Iterations are a way to track issues over a period of time. This allows teams
to track velocity and volatility metrics. Iterations can be used with [milestones](../../project/milestones/index.md)
for tracking over different time periods.

For example, you can use:

- Milestones for Program Increments, which span 8-12 weeks.
- Iterations for Sprints, which span 2 weeks.

In GitLab, iterations are similar to milestones, with a few differences:

- Iterations are only available to groups.
- A group can only have one active iteration at a time.
- Iterations require both a start and an end date.
- Iteration date ranges cannot overlap.

## View the iterations list

To view the iterations list, in a group, go to **{issues}** **Issues > Iterations**.
From there you can create a new iteration or click an iteration to get a more detailed view.

## Create an iteration

NOTE: **Note:**
You need Developer [permissions](../../permissions.md) or higher to create an iteration.

To create an iteration:

1. In a group, go to **{issues}** **Issues > Iterations**.
1. Click **New iteration**.
1. Enter the title, a description (optional), a start date, and a due date.
1. Click **Create iteration**. The iteration details page opens.

## Edit an iteration

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218277) in [GitLab Starter](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.2.

NOTE: **Note:**
You need Developer [permissions](../../permissions.md) or higher to edit an iteration.

To edit an iteration, click the three-dot menu (**{ellipsis_v}**) > **Edit iteration**.

## Enable Iterations **(CORE ONLY)**

GitLab Iterations feature is under development and not ready for production use.
It is deployed behind a feature flag that is **disabled by default**.
[GitLab administrators with access to the GitLab Rails console](../../../administration/feature_flags.md)
can enable it for your instance. `:group_iterations` can be enabled or disabled per-group.

To enable it:

```ruby
# Instance-wide
Feature.enable(:group_iterations)
# or by group
Feature.enable(:group_iterations, Group.find(<group id>))
```

To disable it:

```ruby
# Instance-wide
Feature.disable(:group_iterations)
# or by group
Feature.disable(:group_iterations, Group.find(<group id>))
```

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
