# Epic Boards **(PREMIUM)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2864) in GitLab 14.0.

Epic boards build on the existing [epic tracking functionality](index.md) and
[labels](../../project/labels.md). Your epics appear as cards in vertical lists, organized by their assigned
labels.

To view an epic board, in a group, select **Epics > Boards**.
