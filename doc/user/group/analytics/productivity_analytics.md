# Productivity Analytics

The development cycle is currently a blackbox for many companies. Value stream mapping is difficult to do well. Even when processes are mapped, drilling down in a systematic way into the issues that are slowing the team down is nearly impossible to do. By deep diving into productivity analytics, an EM can understand how well they are deploying their engineering resources and spot patterns across individuals and projects. Productivity can slow down for many reasons ranging from degrading code base to quickly growing teams. Hence, deep diving into productivity analytics first will likely already convey important problematic or exemplary patterns across individuals and teams.

Productivity Analytics provides insights into the time required to approve a merge request, i.e. from first commit until approval and reveals patterns that caused slowdowns.
