This in-development feature might not be available for your use. There can be
[risks when enabling features still in development](../../feature_flags.md#risks-when-enabling-features-still-in-development).
Refer to this feature's version history for more details.

To access Group DevOps Adoption, go to your group and select **Analytics > DevOps Adoption**.

Group DevOps Adoption shows you how individual groups and sub-groups within your organization use the following features:

- Approvals
- Deployments
- Issues
- Merge Requests
- Pipelines
- Runners
- Scans

When managing groups in the UI, you can manage your sub-groups with the **Add/Remove sub-groups**
button, in the top right hand section of your Groups pages.

With DevOps Adoption you can:

- Verify whether you are getting the return on investment that you expected from GitLab.
- Identify specific sub-groups that are lagging in their adoption of GitLab so you can help them along in their DevOps journey.
- Find the sub-groups that have adopted certain features and can provide guidance to other sub-groups on how to use those features.
