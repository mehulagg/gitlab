[Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/321083) in GitLab 13.11 as a [Beta feature](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#beta).

To access Group DevOps Adoption, navigate to your group sidebar and select **Analytics > DevOps Adoption**

Group DevOps Adoption shows you how individual groups and sub-groups within your organization use the following features:

- Issues
- Merge Requests
- Approvals
- Runners
- Pipelines
- Deployments
- Scans

When managing groups in the UI, you can manage your sub-groups with the **Add/Remove sub-groups**
button, in the top right hand section of your Groups pages.

DevOps Adoption allows you to:

- Verify whether you are getting the return on investment that you expected from GitLab.
- Identify specific sub-groups that are lagging in their adoption of GitLab so you can help them along in their DevOps journey.
- Find the sub-groups that have adopted certain features and can provide guidance to other sub-groups on how to use those features.
