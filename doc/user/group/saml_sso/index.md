# SAML SSO for Groups (Beta) **[PREMIUM]**

> Introduced in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 11.0.

This allows SAML to be used for adding users to a group on GitLab.com and other instances where using [site-wide SAML](../../../integration/saml.md) is not possible.

## Enable the beta

Enable the beta by setting the `enable_group_saml` cookie. This can be done with the below JavaScript snippet:

```javascript
javascript:void((function(d){document.cookie='enable_group_saml=' + (document.cookie.indexOf('enable_group_saml=true') >= 0 ?  'false' : 'true') + ';domain=.' + window.location.hostname + ';path=/;expires=' + new Date(Date.now() + 31536000000).toUTCString(); location.reload();})(document));
```

## How to configure

1. Navigate to the group and click Settings -> SAML SSO.
1. Configure your SAML server using the **Assertion consumer service URL** and **Issuer**. See [your identity provider's documentation](#providers) for more details.
1. Configure required assertions using the table below.
1. Find the SSO URL from your Identity Provider and enter it on GitLab.
1. Find and enter the fingerprint for the SAML token signing certificate.

| Assertion consumer service URL | The callback on GitLab where users will be redirected after successfully authenticating with the identity provider. |
| Issuer | How GitLab identifies itself to the identity provider. Also known as a "Relying party trust identifier". |
