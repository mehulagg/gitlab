# Bulk editing issues and merge requests at the project level

NOTE:
Bulk editing issues, epics, and merge requests is also available at the **group level**.
For more details, see
[Bulk editing issues, epics, and merge requests at the group level](../group/bulk_editing/index.md).

If you want to update attributes across multiple issues or merge requests, you can do it
by bulk editing them, that is, editing them together.

Only the items visible on the current page are selected for bulk editing (up to 20).
