To access the feature, navigate to either the issue or merge request list for the
project and click **Edit issues** or **Edit merge requests** available in the tab
bar.This will open a sidebar on the right-hand side of your screen where editable
fields will be displayed. Checkboxes will also appear to the left-hand side of each

Once you have selected all relevant items, choose the appropriate fields and their
values from the sidebar and click 'Update All' to apply your changes.
