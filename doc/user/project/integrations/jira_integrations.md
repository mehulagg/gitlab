# Jira integrations

GitLab can be integrated with [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

[Issues](../issues/index.md) are a tool for discussing ideas, and planning and tracking work.
However, your organization may already use Jira for these purposes, with extensive, established data
and business processes they rely on.

Although you can [migrate](../../../user/project/import/jira.md) your Jira issues and work
exclusively in GitLab, you can also continue to use Jira by using the GitLab Jira integrations.

## Integration types

There are two different Jira integrations that allow different types of cross-referencing between
GitLab activity and Jira issues, with additional features:

- [Jira integration](jira.md), built in to GitLab. In a given GitLab project, it can be configured
  to connect to any Jira instance, either hosted by you or hosted in
  [Atlassian cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/cloud).
- [Jira development panel integration](../../../integration/jira_development_panel.md). Connects all
  GitLab projects under a specified group or personal namespace.

Jira development panel integration configuration depends on whether:

- You're using GitLab.com or a self-managed GitLab instance.
- You're using Jira on [Atlassian cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/cloud) or on your own server.

DVCS means distributed version control system.

## Feature comparison

The integration to use depends on the capabilities your require. You can install both at the same
time.
