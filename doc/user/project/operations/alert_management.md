# Alert Management

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2877) in GitLab 13.0.

Alert Management allows developers to easily discover and view the alerts that their application may be generating. By surfacing error information where the code is being developed, efficiency and awareness can be increased.
