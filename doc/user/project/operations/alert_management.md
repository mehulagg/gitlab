# Alert Management

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2877) in GitLab 13.0.

Alert Management enables developers to easily discover and view the alerts
generated by their application. By surfacing error information where the code is
being developed, efficiency and awareness can be increased.
