# Project access tokens (Alpha) **(CORE ONLY)**

CAUTION: **Warning:**
This is an [Alpha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#alpha) feature, and it is subject to change at any time without
prior notice.

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2587) in GitLab 13.0.
> - It's deployed behind a feature flag, disabled by default.
> - It's disabled on GitLab.com.
> - To use it in GitLab self-managed instances, ask a GitLab administrator to [enable it](#enable-or-disable-project-access-tokens).

Project access tokens are scoped to a project and can be used to authenticate with the [GitLab API](../../../api/README.md#personalproject-access-tokens).

You can also use project access tokens with Git to authenticate over HTTP or SSH.

Project access tokens expire on the date you define, at midnight UTC.

For examples of how you can use a project access token to authenticate with the API, see the following section from our [API Docs](../../../api/README.md#personalproject-access-tokens).

## Creating a project access token

1. Log in to GitLab.
1. Navigate to the project you would like to create an access token for.
1. In the **Settings** menu choose **Access Tokens**.
1. Choose a name and optional expiry date for the token.
1. Choose the [desired scopes](#limiting-scopes-of-a-project-access-token).
1. Click the **Create project access token** button.
1. Save the project access token somewhere safe. Once you leave or refresh
   the page, you won't be able to access it again.

## Project bot users

For each project access token created, a bot user will also be created and added to the project with
["Maintainer" level permissions](../../permissions.md#project-members-permissions).

For the bot:

- The name is set to the name of the token.
- The username is set to `project_{project_id}_bot`, such as `project_123_bot`.

API calls made with a project access token are associated with the corresponding bot user.

These users will appear in **Members** but can not be modified.
Furthermore, the bot user can not be added to any other project.

When the project access token is [revoked](#revoking-a-project-access-token) the bot user will be deleted and all
records will be moved to a system-wide user with the username "Ghost User". For more information,
see [Associated Records](../../profile/account/delete_account.md#associated-records).

Project bot users are a [GitLab-created service account](../../../subscriptions/index.md#self-managed) and do not count as a licensed seat.

## Revoking a project access token

At any time, you can revoke any project access token by clicking the
respective **Revoke** button in **Settings > Access Tokens**.

## Limiting scopes of a project access token

Project access tokens can be created with one or more scopes that allow various
actions that a given token can perform. The available scopes are depicted in
the following table.

| Scope              |  Description |
| ------------------ |  ----------- |
| `api`              | Grants complete read/write access to the scoped project API. |
| `read_api`         | Grants read access to the scoped project API. |
| `read_registry`    | Allows read-access (pull) to [container registry](../../packages/container_registry/index.md) images if a project is private and authorization is required. |
| `write_registry`   | Allows write-access (push) to [container registry](../../packages/container_registry/index.md). |
| `read_repository`  | Allows read-only access (pull) to the repository. |
| `write_repository` | Allows read-write access (pull, push) to the repository. |

### Enable or disable project access tokens

Project access tokens is an [Alpha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#alpha) feature and is not recommended for production use.
It is deployed behind a feature flag that is **disabled by default**.
[GitLab administrators with access to the GitLab Rails console](../../../administration/feature_flags.md)
can enable it for your instance.

To enable it:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:resource_access_token)
```

To disable it:

```ruby
Feature.disable(:resource_access_token)
```
