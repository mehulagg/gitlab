Exporting Merge Requests CSV enables you and your team to export all the data collected from merge requests into a comma-separated values (CSV) file, which stores tabular data in plain text. 

To export Merge Requests to CSV, navigate to your **Merge Requests** from the sidebar of a project and click **Export to CSV**.

Exported files are generated asynchronously and delivered as an email attachment upon generation.

## Limitations

- Export merge requests to CSV is not available at the Groupâ€™s merge request list.
- As the merge request CSV file is sent as an email attachment, the size is limited to 15MB to ensure successful delivery across a range of email providers. If you need to minimize the size of the file, you can narrow the search before export. For example, you can set up exports of open and closed merge requests in separate files. 

### Enable or disable Export Merge Requests to CSV **(CORE ONLY)**

Export merge requests to CSV is under development and not ready for production use. It is
deployed behind a feature flag that is **disabled by default**.
[GitLab administrators with access to the GitLab Rails console](../../../administration/feature_flags.md)
can enable it.

To enable it:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:export_merge_requests_as_csv)
```

To disable it:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:export_merge_requests_as_csv)
```

Optionally, pass a project as an argument to enable for a single project.

```ruby
Feature.enable(:export_merge_requests_as_csv, project)
```
