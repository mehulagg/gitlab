# Getting started with GitLab's Container Network Security

The following installation steps are the recommended way of installing GitLab's Protect capabilities.  Although some capabilities can be installed through GMAv1, it is [recommended and preferred](#using-gmav1-with-gmav2) to install applications through GMAv2 exclusively when using Container Network Security.

## Installation steps

The following steps are recommended to install and use Container Network Security through GitLab:

1. [Install at least one runner and connect it to GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).
1. [Create a group](../../../../group/#create-a-new-group).
1. [Connect a Kubernetes cluster to the group](../../add_remove_clusters.md).
1. [Create a cluster management project and associate it with the Kubernetes cluster](../../../../clusters/management_project.md).

1. Install and configure an Ingress node:

   - [Install the Ingress node via CI/CD (GMAv2)](../../../../clusters/applications.md#install-ingress-using-gitlab-cicd).
   - [Determine the external endpoint via the manual method](../../../../clusters/applications.md#determining-the-external-endpoint-manually).
   - Navigate to the Kubernetes page and enter the [DNS address for the external endpoint](../../index.md#base-domain)
     into the **Base domain** field on the **Details** tab. Save the changes to the Kubernetes
     cluster.

1. [Install and configure Cilium](../../../../clusters/applications.md#install-cilium-using-gitlab-cicd).
1. Be sure to restart all pods that were running before Cilium was installed by running this command
   in your cluster:

   `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,HOSTNETWORK:.spec.hostNetwork --no-headers=true | grep '<none>' | awk '{print "-n "$1" "$2}' | xargs -L 1 -r kubectl delete pod`

It is possible to install and manage Cilium in other ways, such as by installing Cilium manually into a Kubernetes cluster via GitLab's Helm chart and then connecting it back to GitLab. These methods are not currently documented or officially supported.

## Managing Network Policies

Managing NetworkPolicies through GitLab is advantageous over managing the policies in Kubernetes directly as Kubernetes does not provide a GUI editor, a change control process, or a revision history. Network Policies can be managed through GitLab in one of two ways:

1. Management through a yaml file in each application's project (for projects using Auto DevOps) - [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/stages.html#network-policy)
1. Management through GitLab's Policy management UI (for projects not using Auto DevOps) - [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/threat_monitoring/#container-network-policy-management) (Ultimate/Gold only)

Each method comes with its own sets of Pros and Cons:

| | yaml method | UI method (Ultimate/Gold only) |
| Pros | A change control process is possible by requiring [MR Approvals](../../../merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.md). All changes are fully tracked and audited in the same way that Git tracks the history of any file in its repository. | The UI provides a simple rules editor for users who are less familiar with the yaml syntax of NetworkPolicies. This view is a live representation of the policies currently deployed in the Kubernetes cluster. The UI also allows for multiple network policies to be created per environment. |
| Cons | Only one network policy can be deployed per environment (although that policy can be as detailed as is needed).  Additionally, the contents of the yaml file will not represent the actual state of policies that are deployed in Kubernetes if changes were made in Kubernetes directly rather than via the auto-deploy-values.yaml file. | Policy changes are not currently audited and a change control process is not currently available. |

Users are encouraged to choose one of the two methods to manage their policies. If users attempt to use both methods simultaneously, when the application project pipeline is run, the contents of the NetworkPolicy in the auto-deploy-values.yaml file may override policies that are configured via the UI editor.

## Monitoring throughput

To view statistics for Container Network Security, you must have followed the installation steps above and also configured GitLab's integration with Prometheus. Additionally, if you are using custom Helm values for Cilium, you must enable Hubble with flow metrics for each namespace by adding the following lines to
your [Cilium values](../../../../clusters/applications.md#install-cilium-using-gitlab-cicd):

```yaml
global:
  hubble:
    enabled: true
    metrics:
      enabled:
        - 'flow:sourceContext=namespace;destinationContext=namespace'
```

Additional information about the statistics page is available in the [documentation that describes the Threat Management UI](../../../../application_security/threat_monitoring/index.md#container-network-policy).

## Forwarding logs to a SIEM

Cilium logs can be forwarded to a SIEM or an external logging system via syslog protocol by installing and configuring Fluentd. Fluentd can be installed through GitLab in two ways: via the [GMAv1 method](../../../../clusters/applications.md#fluentd) and via the [GMAv2 method](../../../../clusters/applications.md#install-fluentd-using-gitlab-cicd). GitLab strongly encourages using only the GMAv2 method to install Fluentd.

## Viewing the logs

Cilium logs can be viewed by running the following command in your Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl -n gitlab-managed-apps logs -l k8s-app=cilium -c cilium-monitor
```

## Troubleshooting

### Traffic is not being blocked as expected

By default, Cilium is installed in Audit mode only, meaning that NetworkPolicies will log policy violations, but will not block any traffic. To set Cilium to Blocking mode, you need to add the following lines to the `.gitlab/managed-apps/cilium/values.yaml` file in your cluster management project.

```yaml
config:
  policyAuditMode: false

agent:
  monitor:
    eventTypes: ["drop"]
```

### Traffic is not being allowed as expected

Keep in mind that when Cilium is set to blocking mode (rather than Audit mode), NetworkPolicies operate on an allow-list basis. If one or more NetworkPolicies apply to a node, then all traffic that does not match at least one Policy will be blocked. To resolve, add NetworkPolicies defining the traffic that you want to have allowed in to the node.

### Trouble connecting to the cluster

Occasionally your CI/CD pipeline may fail or have trouble connecting to the cluster.  Below are some initial troubleshooting steps that resolve the most common problems:

1. [Clear the cluster cache](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/#clearing-the-cluster-cache)
1. If things still aren't working, a more assertive set of actions may help get things back into a good state:
  1. Stop and [delete the problematic environment](../../../../../ci/environments/index.md#delete-environments-through-the-ui) in GitLab.
  1. Delete the relevant namespace in Kubernetes by running `kubectl delete namespaces <insert-some-namespace-name>` in your Kubernetes cluster
  1. Re-run the application project pipeline to re-deploy the application

### Using GMAv1 with GMAv2

When users use GMAv1 and GMAv2 together on the same cluster, they may experience problems with applications being uninstalled or removed from the cluster.  This is due to the fact that GMAv2 actively uninstalls applications that are installed via GMAv1 and not configured to be installed via GMAv2. It is possible to use a mixture of applications installed via GMAv1 and GMAv2 by ensuring that the GMAv1 applications are installed **after** the GMAv2 cluster management project pipeline runs.  GMAv1 applications will need to be re-installed after each run of that pipeline.  This approach is not recommended as it is error prone and can lead to downtime as applications are uninstalled and later re-installed.  The preferred and recommended path is to install all necessary components via GMAv2 and the cluster management project when using Container Network Security.
