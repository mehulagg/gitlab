# Kubernetes Agent configuration repository **(PREMIUM ONLY)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259669) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.7.
> - It's disabled on GitLab.com. Rolling this feature out to GitLab.com is [planned](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3834).

The GitLab Kubernetes Agent integration supports hosting your configuration for
multiple GitLab Kubernetes Agents in a single repository. These agents can be running
in the same cluster or in multiple clusters, and potentially with more than one Agent per cluster.

The Agent bootstraps with the GitLab installation URL and an authentication token,
and you provide the rest of the configuration in your repository, following
Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) best practices.

A minimal repository layout looks like this, with `my_agent_1` as the name (identity)
of your Agent:

```plaintext
|- .gitlab
    |- agents
       |- my_agent_1
          |- config.yaml
```

## Share configuration with include directives

You can create a more complex repository layout containing a `config.yaml` file
to serve as a shared base, while splitting the unique parts of each configuration
out into separate files:

```plaintext
|- .gitlab
    |- base_for_agents
    |  |- config.yaml
    |- agents
       |- my_agent_1
       |  |- config.yaml
       |- production-agent
          |- config.yaml
```

The `config.yaml` file for each Agent can use the `include: 'some_file_name.yml'`
inclusion syntax (similar to the `.gitlab-ci.yml`
[`include` directive](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#include)) to include the contents of
`../../base_for_agents/config.yaml` in the finished configuration.

## Monitor projects for changes

Your `config.yaml` file contains a `gitops` section, which contains a `manifest_projects`
section. Each `id` in the `manifest_projects` section is the path to a Git repository
with Kubernetes resource definitions in YAML or JSON format. The Agent monitors
each project you declare, and when the project changes, GitLab deploys the changes
using the Agent.

By default, the Agent monitors all resource kinds. You can exclude some types of resources
from monitoring, enabling you to reduce the permissions the GitOps feature needs,
by specifying `resource_exclusions`. To exclude all resources by default, while
only enabling specific named resource, exclude all groups and kinds, and
then use `resource_inclusions` to enable only your desired resources:

```yaml
gitops:
  # Manifest projects are watched by the agent. Whenever a project changes,
  # GitLab deploys the changes using the agent.
  manifest_projects:
    # No authentication mechanisms are currently supported.
  - id: gitlab-org/cluster-integration/gitlab-agent
    # Holds the only API groups and kinds of resources that gitops will monitor.
    # Inclusion rules are evaluated first, then exclusion rules.
    # If there is still no match, resource is monitored.
    resource_inclusions:
    - api_groups:
      - apps
      kinds:
      - '*'
    - api_groups:
      - ''
      kinds:
      - 'ConfigMap'
    # Holds the API groups and kinds of resources to exclude from gitops watch.
    # Inclusion rules are evaluated first, then exclusion rules.
    # If there is still no match, resource is monitored.
    resource_exclusions:
    - api_groups:
      - '*'
      kinds:
      - '*'
    # Namespace to use if not set explicitly in object manifest.
    default_namespace: my-ns
    # Paths inside of the repository to scan for manifest files.
    # Directories with names starting with a dot are ignored.
    paths:
      # Read all .yaml files from team1/app1 directory.
      # See https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#about and
      # https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar/v2#Match for globbing rules.
    - glob: '/team1/app1/*.yaml'
      # Read all .yaml files from team2/apps and all subdirectories
    - glob: '/team2/apps/**/*.yaml'
      # If 'paths' is not specified or is an empty list, the configuration below is used
    - glob: '/**/*.{yaml,yml,json}'
```
