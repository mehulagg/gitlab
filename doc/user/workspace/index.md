# Workspaces

Workspace is the top level namespace for you to manage your GitLab instance.

Features from the admin panel will move into a new object called a Workspace that covers behavior for the entire instance.

A workplace includes settings, data, and features from all groups, subgroups, and projects in an instance (including personal namespaces).
A workplace allows settings to be defined and applied to all groups, subgroups, and projects in an instance
Data from all groups, subgroups and projects in a workspace can be aggregated.
There is a single workspace per instance that is accessible to instance administrators.

This functionality is coming soon.
