# Dependency Scanning **(ULTIMATE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5105) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 10.7.

Dependency Scanning helps to automatically find security vulnerabilities in your dependencies
while you're developing and testing your applications, such as when your
application is using an external (open source) library which is known to be vulnerable.

## Overview

If you're using [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/README.md), you can analyze your dependencies for known
vulnerabilities using Dependency Scanning.
All dependencies are scanned, including the transitive dependencies (also known as nested dependencies).
You can take advantage of Dependency Scanning by either [including the Dependency Scanning template](#configuration)
in your existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file or by implicitly using
the [Auto Dependency Scanning](../../../topics/autodevops/stages.md#auto-dependency-scanning-ultimate)
provided by [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md).

GitLab checks the Dependency Scanning report, compares the found vulnerabilities
between the source and target branches, and shows the information on the
merge request.

The results are sorted by the severity of the vulnerability:

1. Critical
1. High
1. Medium
1. Low
1. Unknown
1. Everything else

## Requirements

To run Dependency Scanning jobs, by default, you need GitLab Runner with the
[`docker`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html) or
[`kubernetes`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html) executor.
If you're using the shared Runners on GitLab.com, this is enabled by default.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
If you use your own Runners, make sure your installed version of Docker
is **not** `19.03.0`. See [troubleshooting information](#error-response-from-daemon-error-processing-tar-file-docker-tar-relocation-error) for details.

Beginning with GitLab 13.0, Docker privileged mode is necessary only if you've [enabled Docker-in-Docker for Dependency Scanning](#enabling-docker-in-docker).

## Contribute your scanner

The [Security Scanner Integration](../../../development/integrations/secure.md) documentation explains how to integrate other security scanners into GitLab.

## Configuration

To enable Dependency Scanning for GitLab 11.9 and later, you must
[include](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#includetemplate) the
[`Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)
that's provided as a part of your GitLab installation.
For GitLab versions earlier than 11.9, you can copy and use the job as defined
that template.

Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
```

The included template will create Dependency Scanning jobs in your CI/CD
pipeline and scan your project's source code for possible vulnerabilities.
The results will be saved as a
[Dependency Scanning report artifact](../../../ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.md#artifactsreportsdependency_scanning-ultimate)
that you can later download and analyze. Due to implementation limitations, we
always take the latest Dependency Scanning artifact available.

### Customizing the Dependency Scanning settings

The Dependency Scanning settings can be changed through [environment variables](#available-variables) by using the
[`variables`](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#variables) parameter in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
For example:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DS_PYTHON_VERSION: 2
```

Because template is [evaluated before](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#include) the pipeline
configuration, the last mention of the variable will take precedence.

### Overriding Dependency Scanning jobs

CAUTION: **Deprecation:**
Beginning in GitLab 13.0, the use of [`only` and `except`](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#onlyexcept-basic)
is no longer supported. When overriding the template, you must use [`rules`](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#rules) instead.

To override a job definition (for example, to change properties like `variables` or `dependencies`),
declare a new job with the same name as the one to override. Place this new job after the template
inclusion and specify any additional keys under it. For example, this disables `DS_REMEDIATE` for
the `gemnasium` analyzer:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

gemnasium-dependency_scanning:
  variables:
    DS_REMEDIATE: "false"
```

### Available variables

Dependency Scanning can be [configured](#customizing-the-dependency-scanning-settings)
using environment variables.

#### Configuring Dependency Scanning

The following variables allow configuration of global dependency scanning settings.

| Environment variable                    | Description |
| --------------------------------------- |------------ |
| `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX`               | Override the name of the Docker registry providing the official default images (proxy). Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md). |
| `DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX`              | **DEPRECATED:** Use `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` instead. |
| `DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS`                  | Override the names of the official default images. Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md). |
| `DS_DISABLE_DIND`                       | Disable Docker-in-Docker and run analyzers [individually](#enabling-docker-in-docker). This variable is `true` by default. |

| `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS`                     | Exclude vulnerabilities from output based on the paths. A comma-separated list of patterns. Patterns can be globs, or file or folder paths (for example, `doc,spec`). Parent directories also match patterns. |

#### Configuring Docker-in-Docker orchestrator

The following variables configure the Docker-in-Docker orchestrator, and therefore are only used when the Docker-in-Docker mode is [enabled](#enabling-docker-in-docker).

| Environment variable                    | Default     | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `DS_ANALYZER_IMAGES`                    |             | Comma-separated list of custom images. The official default images are still enabled. Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md). |
| `DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG`                 |             | Override the Docker tag of the official default images. Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md). |
| `DS_PULL_ANALYZER_IMAGES`               |             | Pull the images from the Docker registry (set to `0` to disable). |
| `DS_DOCKER_CLIENT_NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT`  | 2m          | Time limit for Docker client negotiation. Timeouts are parsed using Go's [`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

| `DS_PULL_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TIMEOUT`        | 5m          | Time limit when pulling an analyzer's image. Timeouts are parsed using Go's [`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration). Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`. For example, `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`. |
| `DS_RUN_ANALYZER_TIMEOUT`               | 20m         | Time limit when running an analyzer. Timeouts are parsed using Go's [`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration). Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`. For example, `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`. |

#### Configuring specific analyzers used by Dependency Scanning

The following variables are used for configuring specific analyzers (used for a specific language/framework).

| Environment variable                    | Analyzer           | Default                      | Description |

### Using private Maven repos

If your private Maven repository requires login credentials,
you can use the `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS` environment variable.

Read more on [how to use private Maven repositories](../index.md#using-private-maven-repos).

### Enabling Docker-in-Docker

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12487) in GitLab Ultimate 12.5.

If needed, you can enable Docker-in-Docker to restore the Dependency Scanning behavior that existed
prior to GitLab 13.0. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Configure GitLab Runner with Docker-in-Docker in [privileged mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#use-docker-in-docker-with-privileged-mode).
1. Set the `DS_DISABLE_DIND` variable to `false`:

   ```yaml
   include:
     - template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

   variables:
     DS_DISABLE_DIND: "false"
   ```

This creates a single `dependency_scanning` job in your CI/CD pipeline instead of multiple
`<analyzer-name>-dependency_scanning` jobs.

## Interacting with the vulnerabilities

Once a vulnerability is found, you can interact with it. Read more on how to
[interact with the vulnerabilities](../index.md#interacting-with-the-vulnerabilities).

## Solutions for vulnerabilities (auto-remediation)

Some vulnerabilities can be fixed by applying the solution that GitLab
automatically generates. Read more about the
[solutions for vulnerabilities](../index.md#solutions-for-vulnerabilities-auto-remediation).

## Security Dashboard

The Security Dashboard is a good place to get an overview of all the security
vulnerabilities in your groups, projects and pipelines. Read more about the
[Security Dashboard](../security_dashboard/index.md).

## Vulnerabilities database update

For more information about the vulnerabilities database update, check the
[maintenance table](../index.md#maintenance-and-update-of-the-vulnerabilities-database).

## Dependency List

An additional benefit of Dependency Scanning is the ability to view your
project's dependencies and their known vulnerabilities. Read more about
the [Dependency List](../dependency_list/index.md).

## Reports JSON format

CAUTION: **Caution:**
The JSON report artifacts are not a public API of Dependency Scanning and their format may change in the future.

The Dependency Scanning tool emits a JSON report file. Here is an example of the report structure with all important parts of
it highlighted:

CAUTION: **Deprecation:**
Beginning with GitLab 12.9, dependency scanning no longer reports `undefined` severity and confidence levels.

This table describes the report file structure nodes and their meaning. All fields are mandatory to be present in
the report JSON, unless stated otherwise. The presence of optional fields depends on the underlying analyzers used.

Please check the [Release Process documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/release/blob/master/docs/release_process.md).

## Contributing to the vulnerability database

You can search the [gemnasium-db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) project
to find a vulnerability in the Gemnasium database.
You can also [submit new vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Running Dependency Scanning in an offline environment

For self-managed GitLab instances in an environment with limited, restricted, or intermittent access
to external resources through the internet, some adjustments are required for Dependency Scanning
jobs to run successfully. For more information, see [Offline environments](../offline_deployments/index.md).

### Requirements for offline Dependency Scanning

Here are the requirements for using Dependency Scanning in an offline environment:

- Keep Docker-In-Docker disabled (default).
- GitLab Runner with the [`docker` or `kubernetes` executor](#requirements).
- Docker Container Registry with locally available copies of Dependency Scanning [analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers) images.
- Host an offline Git copy of the [gemnasium-db advisory database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/)
- _Only if scanning Ruby projects_: Host an offline Git copy of the [advisory database](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db).
- _Only if scanning npm/yarn projects_: Host an offline copy of the [retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/) [node](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/blob/master/repository/npmrepository.json) and [js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/blob/master/repository/jsrepository.json) advisory databases.

NOTE: **Note:**
GitLab Runner has a [default `pull policy` of `always`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#using-the-always-pull-policy),
meaning the Runner tries to pull Docker images from the GitLab container registry even if a local
copy is available. GitLab Runner's [`pull_policy` can be set to `if-not-present`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#using-the-if-not-present-pull-policy)
in an offline environment if you prefer using only locally available Docker images. However, we
recommend keeping the pull policy setting to `always` if not in an offline environment, as this
enables the use of updated scanners in your CI/CD pipelines.

### Make GitLab Dependency Scanning analyzer images available inside your Docker registry

For Dependency Scanning with all [supported languages and frameworks](#supported-languages-and-package-managers),
import the following default Dependency Scanning analyzer images from `registry.gitlab.com` into
your [local Docker container registry](../../packages/container_registry/index.md):

```plaintext
registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium:2
registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven:2
registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2
registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js:2
registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bundler-audit:2
```

The process for importing Docker images into a local offline Docker registry depends on
**your network security policy**. Please consult your IT staff to find an accepted and approved
process by which external resources can be imported or temporarily accessed.
Note that these scanners are [updated periodically](../index.md#maintenance-and-update-of-the-vulnerabilities-database)
with new definitions, so consider if you can make periodic updates yourself.

For details on saving and transporting Docker images as a file, see Docker's documentation on
[`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/), [`docker load`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/),
[`docker export`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/export/), and [`docker import`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import/).

### Set Dependency Scanning CI job variables to use local Dependency Scanning analyzers

Add the following configuration to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. You must replace
`DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX` to refer to your local Docker container registry:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX: "docker-registry.example.com/analyzers"
  GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL: "gitlab.example.com/gemnasium-db.git"
  GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY: "true"
```

See explanations of the variables above in the [configuration section](#configuration).

### Specific settings for languages and package managers

See the following sections for configuring specific languages and package managers.

#### JavaScript (npm and yarn) projects

Add the following to the variables section of `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
RETIREJS_JS_ADVISORY_DB: "example.com/jsrepository.json"
RETIREJS_NODE_ADVISORY_DB: "example.com/npmrepository.json"
```

#### Ruby (gem) projects

Add the following to the variables section of `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
BUNDLER_AUDIT_ADVISORY_DB_REF_NAME: "master"
BUNDLER_AUDIT_ADVISORY_DB_URL: "gitlab.example.com/ruby-advisory-db.git"
```

#### Java (Maven) projects

When using self-signed certificates, add the following job section to the `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning:
  variables:
    MAVEN_CLI_OPTS: "-s settings.xml -Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.insecure=true -Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.allowall=true -Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.ignore.validity.dates=true"
```

#### Java (Gradle) projects

When using self-signed certificates, add the following job section to the `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning:
  before_script:
    - echo -n | openssl s_client -connect maven-repo.example.com:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/internal.crt
    - keytool -importcert -file /tmp/internal.crt -cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
```

This adds the self-signed certificates of your Maven repository to the Java KeyStore of the analyzer's Docker image.

#### Scala (sbt) projects

When using self-signed certificates, add the following job section to the `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
gemnasium-maven-dependency_scanning:
  before_script:
    - echo -n | openssl s_client -connect maven-repo.example.com:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/internal.crt
    - keytool -importcert -file /tmp/internal.crt -cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
```

This adds the self-signed certificates of your Maven repository to the Java KeyStore of the analyzer's Docker image.

#### Python (setuptools)

When using self-signed certificates for your private PyPi repository, no extra job configuration (aside
from the template `.gitlab-ci.yml` above) is needed. However, you must update your `setup.py` to
ensure that it can reach your private repository. Here is an example configuration:

1. Update `setup.py` to create a `dependency_links` attribute pointing at your private repository for each
   dependency in the `install_requires` list:

   ```python
   install_requires=['pyparsing>=2.0.3'],
   dependency_links=['https://pypi.example.com/simple/pyparsing'],
   ```

1. Fetch the certificate from your repository URL and add it to the project:

   ```shell
   echo -n | openssl s_client -connect pypi.example.com:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > internal.crt
   ```

1. Point `setup.py` at the newly downloaded certificate:

   ```python
   import setuptools.ssl_support
   setuptools.ssl_support.cert_paths = ['internal.crt']
   ```

## Limitations

### Referencing local dependencies using a path in JavaScript projects

The [Retire.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js) analyzer
doesn't support dependency references made with [local paths](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#local-paths)
in the `package.json` of JavaScript projects. The dependency scan outputs the following error for
such references:

```plaintext
ERROR: Could not find dependencies: <dependency-name>. You may need to run npm install
```

As a workaround, remove the [`retire.js`](analyzers.md#selecting-specific-analyzers) analyzer from
[DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS](#configuring-dependency-scanning).

## Troubleshooting

### Error response from daemon: error processing tar file: docker-tar: relocation error

This error occurs when the Docker version that runs the Dependency Scanning job is `19.03.00`.
Consider updating to Docker `19.03.1` or greater. Older versions are not
affected. Read more in
[this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13830#note_211354992 "Current SAST container fails").
