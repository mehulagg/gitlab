# Coverage Guided Fuzz Testing **(ULTIMATE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3226) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.2 as an [Alpha feature](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#alpha).

GitLab allows you to add coverage-guided fuzz testing to your pipelines. This helps you discover
bugs and potential security issues that other QA processes may miss. Coverage-guided fuzzing sends
random inputs to an instrumented version of your application in an effort to cause unexpected
behavior, such as a crash. Such behavior indicates a bug that you should address.

We recommend that you use fuzz testing in addition to the other security scanners in [GitLab Secure](../index.md)
and your own test processes. If you're using [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/README.md),
you can run your coverage guided fuzz tests as part your CI/CD workflow. You can take advantage of
Coverage Guided Fuzzing by including the CI job in your existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

## Supported fuzzing engines and languages

GitLab supports these languages through the fuzzing engine listed for each. We currently provide a Docker image for apps written in Go, but you can test the other languages below by providing a Docker image with the fuzz engine to run your app.

| Language | Fuzzing Engine | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| C/C++    | [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) | [c-cpp-example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/c-cpp-fuzzing-example) |
| GoLang   | [go-fuzz (libFuzzer support)](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) | [go-fuzzing-example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/go-fuzzing-example) |
| Rust     | [cargo-fuzz (libFuzzer support)](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz) |         |

## Configuration

To enable fuzzing, you must
[include](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#includetemplate)
the [`Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml)
provided as part of your GitLab installation.

To do so, add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml
```

The included template makes available the [hidden job](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#hide-jobs)
`.fuzz_base`, which you must [extend](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#extends) for each of your fuzz
targets. Each fuzz target **must** have a separate job. For example, the
[go-fuzzing-example project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/go-fuzzing-example)
contains one job that extends `.fuzz_base` for its single fuzz target.

Note that the hidden job `.fuzz_base` uses several YAML keys that you must not override in your own
job. If you include these keys in your own job, you must copy their original content. These keys
are:

- `before_script`
- `artifacts`
- `rules`

The `my_fuzz_target` job (the separate job for your fuzz target) does the following:

- Extends `.fuzz_base`.
- Compiles the fuzz target with [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz).
- Runs the target with the `gitlab-cov-fuzz` command, which is available to each job that extends
  `.fuzz_base`.
- Runs on a fuzz stage that usually comes after a test stage.

The `gitlab-cov-fuzz` is a command-line tool that runs the instrumented application. It parses and
analyzes the exception information that the fuzzer outputs. It also downloads the [corpus](#glossary)
and crash events from previous pipelines automatically. This helps your fuzz targets build on the progress of
previous fuzzing jobs. The parsed crash events and data are written to
`gl-coverage-fuzzing-report.json`.

### Artifacts

Each fuzzing step outputs these artifacts:

- `gl-coverage-fuzzing-report.json`: This file's format may change in future releases.
- `artifacts.zip`: This file contains two directories:
  - `corpus`: Holds all test cases generated by the current and all previous jobs.
  - `crashes`: Holds all crash events the current job encountered as well as those not fixed in
    previous jobs.

### Types of Fuzzing Jobs

There are two types of jobs:

- Fuzzing: Standard fuzzing session. You can configure a long session through a user defined
  timeout.
- Regression: Run the fuzz targets through the accumulated test cases generated by previous fuzzing
  sessions plus fixed crashes from previous sessions. This is usually very quick.

Here's our current suggestion for configuring your fuzz target's timeout:

- Set `COVERAGE_FUZZING_BRANCH` to the branch where you want to run long-running (async) fuzzing
  jobs. This is `master` by default.
- Use regression or short-running fuzzing jobs for other branches or merge requests.

This suggestion helps find new bugs on the development branch and catch old bugs in merge requests
(like unit tests).

You can configure this by passing `--regression=false/true` to `gitlab-cov-fuzz` as the [Go example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/go-fuzzing-example/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
shows. Also note that `gitlab-cov-fuzz` is a wrapper, so you can pass those arguments to configure
any option available in the underlying fuzzing engine.

### Available variables

| Environment variable      | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `COVERAGE_FUZZING_BRANCH` | The branch for long-running fuzzing jobs. The default is `master`. |
| `CI_SEED_CORPUS`          | Path to a seed corpus directory. The default is empty.             |

The files in the seed corpus (`CI_SEED_CORPUS`), if provided, aren't updated unless you commit new
files to your Git repository. There's usually no need to frequently update the seed corpus. As part
of the GitLab artifacts system, GitLab saves in a corpus directory the new test cases that every run
generates. In any subsequent runs, GitLab also reuses the generated corpus together with the seed
corpus.

### Additional Configuration

The `gitlab-cov-fuzz` command passes all arguments it receives to the underlying fuzzing engine. You
can therefore use all the options available in that fuzzing engine. For more information on these
options, see the underlying fuzzing engine's documentation.

### Glossary

- Seed corpus: The set of test cases given as initial input to the fuzz target. This usually speeds
  up the fuzz target substantially. This can be either manually created test cases or auto-generated
  with the fuzz target itself from previous runs.
- Corpus: The set of meaningful test cases that are generated while the fuzzer is running. Each
  meaningful test case produces new coverage in the tested program. It's advised to re-use the
  corpus and pass it to subsequent runs.
