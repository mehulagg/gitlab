# Vulnerability Report **(ULTIMATE)**

The Vulnerability Report provides information about vulnerabilities from the scans of the most
recent branch merged into the default branch. It is available at the group and project level.

The Vulnerability Report includes:

- Totals of vulnerabilities per severity level: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info, Unknown
- A filter for each of a vulnerability's attributes: status, severity, scanner, activity. The
  group-level report also has a project filter. The default filter includes all detected and
  confirmed vulnerabilities.
- Details of each vulnerability:
  - Detected date
  - Status
  - Severity
  - Description
  - Identifier
  - Scanner
  - Activity (including related issues or available solutions)

The project-level Vulnerability Report includes additional information:

- A time stamp showing when it was updated, including a link to the latest pipeline.
- In the case of any pipeline failures, the number of failures is indicated. Select the failure
  notification to view the **Failed jobs** tab of the pipeline page.

From the Vulnerability Report you can:

- [Filter the list of vulnerabilities](#filter-the-list-of-vulnerabilities).
- [View more details about a vulnerability](#view-details-of-a-vulnerability).
- [View an issue raised for a vulnerability](#view-issues-raised-for-a-vulnerability).
- [Change the status of vulnerabilities](#change-status-of-vulnerabilities).
- [Export details of vulnerabilities](#export-vulnerability-details).

## Vulnerability filters

You can filter the vulnerabilities table by:

| Filter   | Available options |
|:---------|:------------------|
| Status   | Detected, Confirmed, Dismissed, Resolved |
| Severity | Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info, Unknown |
| Scanner  | [Available scanners](../index.md#security-scanning-tools). |
| Project  | Projects configured in the Security Center settings, or all projects in the group for the group-level report. This filter is not displayed on the project level vulnerability report. |
| Activity | Vulnerabilities with issues and vulnerabilities that are no longer detected in the default branch. |

### Filter the list of vulnerabilities

To filter the list of vulnerabilities:

1. Select a filter.
1. Select values from the dropdown.
1. Repeat the above steps for each desired filter.

The vulnerability table is applied immediately. The vulnerability severity totals are also updated.

The filters' criteria are combined to show only vulnerabilities matching all criteria.
An exception to this behavior is the Activity filter. For more details about how it works, see
[Activity filter](#activity-filter).

### Activity filter

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259255) in GitLab 13.9

The Activity filter behaves differently from the other filters. The selected values form mutually
exclusive sets to allow for precisely locating the desired vulnerability records. Additionally, not
all options can be selected in combination.

Selection behavior when using the Activity filter:

| Activity selection                  | Results displayed |
|:------------------------------------|:------------------|
|  All                                | Vulnerabilities with any Activity status (same as ignoring this filter). Selecting this will deselect any other Activity filter options. |
|  No activity                        | Only vulnerabilities without either an associated Issue or that are no longer detected. Selecting this will deselect any other Activity filter options. |
|  With issues                        | Only vulnerabilities with one or more associated issues. Does not include vulnerabilities that also are no longer detected. |
|  No longer detected                 | Only vulnerabilities that are no longer detected in the latest pipeline scan of the `default` branch. Does not include vulnerabilities with one or more associated issues. |
|  With issues and No longer detected | Only vulnerabilities that have one or more associated issues and also are no longer detected in the latest pipeline scan of the `default` branch. |

## View details of a vulnerability

To view more details of a vulnerability, select the vulnerability's **Description**. The
[vulnerability's details](../vulnerabilities) page is opened.

## View issues raised for a vulnerability

The **Activity** column indicates the number of issues that have been created for the vulnerability.
Hover over an **Activity** entry and select a link go to that issue.

## Change status of vulnerabilities

To change the status of vulnerabilities in the table:

1. Select the checkbox for each vulnerability you want to update the status of.
1. In the dropdown that appears select the desired status, then select **Change status**.

## Project Vulnerability Report

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6165) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 11.1.

The vulnerabilities that exist in your project's
[default branch](../../project/repository/branches/index.md#default-branch) are accessed by navigating to
**Security & Compliance > Vulnerability Report**.

The project vulnerability report first displays the time at which the last pipeline completed on the project's
default branch. There's also a link to view this in more detail. In the case of any pipeline failures,
the number of failures is indicated. The failure notification takes you directly to
the **Failed jobs** tab of the pipeline page.

## Export vulnerability details

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213014) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 12.10.

You can export details of the vulnerabilities listed in the Vulnerability Report. The export format
is CSV (comma separated values). Note that all vulnerabilities are included because filters don't
apply to the export.

Fields included are:

- Group name
- Project name
- Scanner type
- Scanner name
- Status
- Vulnerability
- Details
- Additional information
- Severity
- [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/) (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- Other identifiers

### Export details in CSV format

To export details of all vulnerabilities listed in the Vulnerability Report, select **Export**.

The details are retrieved from the database, then the CSV file is downloaded to your local
computer.

NOTE:
It may take several minutes for the download to start if your project contains
thousands of vulnerabilities. Don't close the page until the download finishes.
