# GitLab Vulnerability Reports **(ULTIMATE)**

Each vulnerability report contains vulnerabilities from the latest scans that were merged
into the default branch. There are vulnerability reports available at three levels, each with an associated Security Dashboard:

- [project level](../security_dashboard/index.md#project-security-dashboard) 
- [group level](../security_dashboard/index.md#group-security-dashboard) 
- [instance level configurable Security Center](#instance-security-center) 

The vulnerability reports display the total number of vulnerabilities by severity (for example,
Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info, Unknown). Below this, a table shows each vulnerability's detedcted date, status, severity, description, identifier, the scanner where it was detected, and activity (including related issues or available solutions). By default, the vulnerability report is filtered to display all detected and confirmed vulnerabilities.

You can filter which vulnerabilities display by:

| Filter | Available Options |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Detected, Confirmed, Dismissed, Resolved |
| Severity | Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info, Unknown |
| Scanner | [Available Scanners](../index.md#security-scanning-tools) |
| Project | Projects configured in the Security Center settings, or all projects within the group for the group level report. This filter is not displayed on the project level vulnerability report |

Clicking any vulnerability in the table takes you to its
[vulnerability details](../vulnerabilities) page to see more information on that vulnerability.

To create an issue associated with the vulnerability, click the **Create Issue** button.

![Create an issue for the vulnerability](img/vulnerability_details_create_issue_v13_7.png)

After you create the issue, the linked issue icon in the vulnerability list:

- Indicates that an issue has been created for that vulnerability.
- Shows a tooltip that contains a link to the issue.

Contents of the unfiltered vulnerability report can be exported using our [export feature](#export-vulnerabilities)

You can also dismiss vulnerabilities in the table:

1. Select the checkbox for each vulnerability you want to dismiss.
1. In the menu that appears, select the reason for dismissal and click **Dismiss Selected**.

## Project Vulnerability Report

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/6165) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 11.1.

The vulnerabilities that exist in your project's
[default branch](../../project/repository/branches/index.md#default-branch) are accessed by navigating to
**Security & Compliance > Vulnerability Report**. 

The project vulnerability report first displays the time at which the last pipeline completed on the project's
default branch. There's also a link to view this in more detail. In the case of any pipeline failures,
the number of failures is indicated. The failure notification takes you directly to
the **Failed jobs** tab of the pipeline page.

## Export vulnerabilities

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213014) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 12.10.

You can export all your vulnerabilities in CSV (comma separated values) format by clicking the
**{upload}** **Export** button located at top right of the Security Dashboard. When the report is
ready, the CSV report downloads to your local machine. The report contains all vulnerabilities for
the projects defined in the Security Dashboard, as filters don't apply to the export function.

NOTE:
It may take several minutes for the download to start if your project contains
thousands of vulnerabilities. Don't close the page until the download finishes.

The fields in the export include:

- Group Name
- Project Name
- Scanner Type
- Scanner Name
- Status
- Vulnerability
- Details
- Additional Info
- Severity
- [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/) (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- Other Identifiers
