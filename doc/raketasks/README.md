# Rake tasks **(CORE ONLY)**

GitLab provides [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) tasks for common administration and operational processes.

GitLab Rake tasks are performed using:

- `gitlab-rake <raketask>` for [Omnibus GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/README.html) installations.
- `bundle exec rake <raketask>` for [source](../install/installation.md) installations.

## Available Rake tasks
