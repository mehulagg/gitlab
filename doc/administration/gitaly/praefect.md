# Gitaly Cluster

[Gitaly](index.md), the service that provides storage for Git repositories, can
be run in a clustered configuration to increase fault tolerance. In this
configuration, every Git repository is stored on every Gitaly node in the
cluster. Multiple clusters (or shards), can be configured.

NOTE: **Note:**
Gitaly Clusters can be created using [GitLab Core](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/#self-managed)
and higher tiers. However, technical support is limited to GitLab Premium and Ultimate customers
only. Not available in GitLab.com.

Praefect is a router and transaction manager for Gitaly, and a required
component for running a Gitaly Cluster.

![Architecture diagram](img/praefect_architecture_v12_10.png)

Using a Gitaly Cluster increase fault tolerance by:

- Replicating write operations to warm standby Gitaly nodes.
- Detecting Gitaly node failures.
- Automatically routing Git requests to an available Gitaly node.

The availability objectives for Gitaly clusters are:

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Less than 1 minute.

  Writes are replicated asynchronously. Any writes that have not been replicated
  to the newly promoted primary are lost.

  [Strong consistency](#strong-consistency) can be used to avoid loss in some
  circumstances.

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Less than 10 seconds.

  Outages are detected by a health checks run by each Praefect node every
  second. Failover requires ten consecutive failed health checks on each
  Praefect node.

  [Faster outage detection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2608)
  is planned to improve this to less than 1 second.

The current version supports:

- Eventual consistency of the secondary replicas.
- Automatic failover from the primary to the secondary.
- Reporting of possible data loss if replication queue is non empty.
- Marking the newly promoted primary read only if possible data loss is
  detected.

Follow the [HA Gitaly epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1489)
for improvements including
[horizontally distributing reads](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2013).

## Requirements for configuring a Gitaly Cluster

The minimum recommended configuration for a Gitaly Cluster requires:

- 1 load balancer
- 1 PostgreSQL server (PostgreSQL 11 or newer)
- 3 Praefect nodes
- 3 Gitaly nodes (1 primary, 2 secondary)

See the [design
document](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/design_ha.md)
for implementation details.

## Setup Instructions

If you [installed](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) GitLab using the Omnibus
package (highly recommended), follow the steps below:

1. [Preparation](#preparation)
1. [Configuring the Praefect database](#postgresql)
1. [Configuring the Praefect proxy/router](#praefect)
1. [Configuring each Gitaly node](#gitaly) (once for each Gitaly node)
1. [Configure the load balancer](#load-balancer)
1. [Updating the GitLab server configuration](#gitlab)
1. [Configure Grafana](#grafana)

### Preparation

Before beginning, you should already have a working GitLab instance. [Learn how
to install GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).

Provision a PostgreSQL server (PostgreSQL 11 or newer). Configuration through
the Omnibus GitLab distribution is not yet supported. Follow this
[issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2476) for updates.

Prepare all your new nodes by [installing
GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).

- 1 Praefect node (minimal storage required)
- 3 Gitaly nodes (high CPU, high memory, fast storage)
- 1 GitLab server

You will need the IP/host address for each node.

1. `LOAD_BALANCER_SERVER_ADDRESS`: the IP/host address of the load balancer
1. `POSTGRESQL_SERVER_ADDRESS`: the IP/host address of the PostgreSQL server
1. `PRAEFECT_HOST`: the IP/host address of the Praefect server
1. `GITALY_HOST`: the IP/host address of each Gitaly server
1. `GITLAB_HOST`: the IP/host address of the GitLab server

If you are using a cloud provider, you can look up the addresses for each server through your cloud provider's management console.

If you are using Google Cloud Platform, SoftLayer, or any other vendor that provides a virtual private cloud (VPC) you can use the private addresses for each cloud instance (corresponds to “internal address” for Google Cloud Platform) for `PRAEFECT_HOST`, `GITALY_HOST`, and `GITLAB_HOST`.

#### Secrets

The communication between components is secured with different secrets, which
are described below. Before you begin, generate a unique secret for each, and
make note of it. This will make it easy to replace these placeholder tokens
with secure tokens as you complete the setup process.

1. `GITLAB_SHELL_SECRET_TOKEN`: this is used by Git hooks to make callback HTTP
   API requests to GitLab when accepting a Git push. This secret is shared with
   GitLab Shell for legacy reasons.
1. `PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN`: repositories hosted on your Praefect cluster can
   only be accessed by Gitaly clients that carry this token.
1. `PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN`: this token is used for replication traffic inside
   your Praefect cluster. This is distinct from `PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN`
   because Gitaly clients must not be able to access internal nodes of the
   Praefect cluster directly; that could lead to data loss.
1. `PRAEFECT_SQL_PASSWORD`: this password is used by Praefect to connect to
   PostgreSQL.

We will note in the instructions below where these secrets are required.

### PostgreSQL

NOTE: **Note:**
Do not store the GitLab application database and the Praefect
database on the same PostgreSQL server if using
[Geo](../geo/replication/index.md). The replication state is internal to each instance
of GitLab and should not be replicated.

To complete this section you will need:

- 1 Praefect node
- 1 PostgreSQL server (PostgreSQL 11 or newer)
  - An SQL user with permissions to create databases

During this section, we will configure the PostgreSQL server, from the Praefect
node, using `psql` which is installed by Omnibus GitLab.

1. SSH into the **Praefect** node and login as root:

   ```shell
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Connect to the PostgreSQL server with administrative access. This is likely
   the `postgres` user. The database `template1` is used because it is created
   by default on all PostgreSQL servers.

   ```shell
   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/psql -U postgres -d template1 -h POSTGRESQL_SERVER_ADDRESS
   ```

   Create a new user `praefect` which will be used by Praefect. Replace
   `PRAEFECT_SQL_PASSWORD` with the strong password you generated in the
   preparation step.

   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE praefect WITH LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'PRAEFECT_SQL_PASSWORD';
   ```

1. Reconnect to the PostgreSQL server, this time as the `praefect` user:

   ```shell
   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/psql -U praefect -d template1 -h POSTGRESQL_SERVER_ADDRESS
   ```

   Create a new database `praefect_production`. By creating the database while
   connected as the `praefect` user, we are confident they have access.

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE praefect_production WITH ENCODING=UTF8;
   ```

The database used by Praefect is now configured.

### Praefect

To complete this section you will need:

- [Configured PostgreSQL server](#postgresql), including:
  - IP/host address (`POSTGRESQL_SERVER_ADDRESS`)
  - password (`PRAEFECT_SQL_PASSWORD`)

Praefect should be run on a dedicated node. Do not run Praefect on the
application server, or a Gitaly node.

1. SSH into the **Praefect** node and login as root:

   ```shell
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Disable all other services by editing `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   # Disable all other services on the Praefect node
   postgresql['enable'] = false
   redis['enable'] = false
   nginx['enable'] = false
   prometheus['enable'] = false
   grafana['enable'] = false
   puma['enable'] = false
   sidekiq['enable'] = false
   gitlab_workhorse['enable'] = false
   gitaly['enable'] = false

   # Enable only the Praefect service
   praefect['enable'] = true

   # Prevent database connections during 'gitlab-ctl reconfigure'
   gitlab_rails['rake_cache_clear'] = false
   gitlab_rails['auto_migrate'] = false
   ```

1. Configure **Praefect** to listen on network interfaces by editing
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   praefect['listen_addr'] = '0.0.0.0:2305'

   # Enable Prometheus metrics access to Praefect. You must use firewalls
   # to restrict access to this address/port.
   praefect['prometheus_listen_addr'] = '0.0.0.0:9652'
   ```

1. Configure a strong `auth_token` for **Praefect** by editing
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. This will be needed by clients outside the cluster
   (like GitLab Shell) to communicate with the Praefect cluster :

   ```ruby
   praefect['auth_token'] = 'PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN'
   ```

1. Configure **Praefect** to connect to the PostgreSQL database by editing
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

   You will need to replace `POSTGRESQL_SERVER_ADDRESS` with the IP/host address
   of the database, and `PRAEFECT_SQL_PASSWORD` with the strong password set
   above.

   ```ruby
   praefect['database_host'] = 'POSTGRESQL_SERVER_ADDRESS'
   praefect['database_port'] = 5432
   praefect['database_user'] = 'praefect'
   praefect['database_password'] = 'PRAEFECT_SQL_PASSWORD'
   praefect['database_dbname'] = 'praefect_production'
   ```

   If you want to use a TLS client certificate, the options below can be used:

   ```ruby
   # Connect to PostreSQL using a TLS client certificate
   # praefect['database_sslcert'] = '/path/to/client-cert'
   # praefect['database_sslkey'] = '/path/to/client-key'

   # Trust a custom certificate authority
   # praefect['database_sslrootcert'] = '/path/to/rootcert'
   ```

   By default Praefect will refuse to make an unencrypted connection to
   PostgreSQL. You can override this by uncommenting the following line:

   ```ruby
   # praefect['database_sslmode'] = 'disable'
   ```

1. Configure the **Praefect** cluster to connect to each Gitaly node in the
   cluster by editing `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

   The virtual storage's name must match the configured storage name in GitLab
   configuration. In a later step, we configure the storage name as `default`
   so we use `default` here as well. This cluster has three Gitaly nodes `gitaly-1`,
   `gitaly-2`, and `gitaly-3`, which will be replicas of each other.

   CAUTION: **Caution:**
   If you have data on an already existing storage called
   `default`, you should configure the virtual storage with another name and
   [migrate the data to the Praefect storage](#migrating-existing-repositories-to-praefect)
   afterwards.

   Replace `PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN` with a strong secret, which will be used by
   Praefect when communicating with Gitaly nodes in the cluster. This token is
   distinct from the `PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN`.

   Replace `GITALY_HOST` with the IP/host address of the each Gitaly node.

   More Gitaly nodes can be added to the cluster to increase the number of
   replicas. More clusters can also be added for very large GitLab instances.

   NOTE: **Note:**
   The `gitaly-1` node is currently denoted the primary. This
   can be used to manually fail from one node to another. This will be removed
   in the [future](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2634).

   ```ruby
   # Name of storage hash must match storage name in git_data_dirs on GitLab
   # server ('praefect') and in git_data_dirs on Gitaly nodes ('gitaly-1')
   praefect['virtual_storages'] = {
     'default' => {
       'gitaly-1' => {
         'address' => 'tcp://GITALY_HOST:8075',
         'token'   => 'PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN',
         'primary' => true
       },
       'gitaly-2' => {
         'address' => 'tcp://GITALY_HOST:8075',
         'token'   => 'PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN'
       },
       'gitaly-3' => {
         'address' => 'tcp://GITALY_HOST:8075',
         'token'   => 'PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN'
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2013) in GitLab 13.1 and later, enable [distribution of reads](#distributed-reads).

1. Save the changes to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and [reconfigure
   Praefect](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure):

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. To ensure that Praefect [has updated its Prometheus listen
   address](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2734), [restart
   Gitaly](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-restart):

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl restart praefect
   ```

1. Verify that Praefect can reach PostgreSQL:

   ```shell
   sudo -u git /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml sql-ping
   ```

   If the check fails, make sure you have followed the steps correctly. If you
   edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`, remember to run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`
   again before trying the `sql-ping` command.

**The steps above must be completed for each Praefect node!**

## Enabling TLS support

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/1698) in GitLab 13.2.

Praefect supports TLS encryption. To communicate with a Praefect instance that listens
for secure connections, you must:

- Use a `tls://` URL scheme in the `gitaly_address` of the corresponding storage entry
  in the GitLab configuration.
- Bring your own certificates because this isn't provided automatically. The certificate
  corresponding to each Praefect server must be installed on that Praefect server.

Additionally the certificate, or its certificate authority, must be installed on all Gitaly servers
and on all Praefect clients that communicate with it following the procedure described in
[GitLab custom certificate configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/ssl.html#install-custom-public-certificates) (and repeated below).

Note the following:

- The certificate must specify the address you use to access the Praefect server. If
  addressing the Praefect server by:

  - Hostname, you can either use the Common Name field for this, or add it as a Subject
    Alternative Name.
  - IP address, you must add it as a Subject Alternative Name to the certificate.

- You can configure Praefect servers with both an unencrypted listening address
  `listen_addr` and an encrypted listening address `tls_listen_addr` at the same time.
  This allows you to do a gradual transition from unencrypted to encrypted traffic, if
  necessary.

To configure Praefect with TLS:

**For Omnibus GitLab**

1. Create certificates for Praefect servers.
1. On the Praefect servers, create the `/etc/gitlab/ssl` directory and copy your key
   and certificate there:

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/gitlab/ssl
   sudo chmod 755 /etc/gitlab/ssl
   sudo cp key.pem cert.pem /etc/gitlab/ssl/
   sudo chmod 644 key.pem cert.pem
   ```

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and add:

   ```ruby
   praefect['tls_listen_addr'] = "0.0.0.0:3305"
   praefect['certificate_path'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/cert.pem"
   praefect['key_path'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/key.pem"
   ```

1. Save the file and [reconfigure GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure).
1. On the Praefect clients (including each Gitaly server), copy the certificates,
   or their certificate authority, into `/etc/gitlab/trusted-certs`:

   ```shell
   sudo cp cert.pem /etc/gitlab/trusted-certs/
   ```

1. On the Praefect clients (except Gitaly servers), edit `git_data_dirs` in
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` as follows:

   ```ruby
   git_data_dirs({
     'default' => { 'gitaly_address' => 'tls://praefect1.internal:3305' },
     'storage1' => { 'gitaly_address' => 'tls://praefect2.internal:3305' },
   })
   ```

1. Save the file and [reconfigure GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure).

**For installations from source**

1. Create certificates for Praefect servers.
1. On the Praefect servers, create the `/etc/gitlab/ssl` directory and copy your key and certificate
   there:

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/gitlab/ssl
   sudo chmod 755 /etc/gitlab/ssl
   sudo cp key.pem cert.pem /etc/gitlab/ssl/
   sudo chmod 644 key.pem cert.pem
   ```

1. On the Praefect clients (including each Gitaly server), copy the certificates,
   or their certificate authority, into the system trusted certificates:

   ```shell
   sudo cp cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/praefect.crt
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

1. On the Praefect clients (except Gitaly servers), edit `storages` in
   `/home/git/gitlab/config/gitlab.yml` as follows:

   ```yaml
   gitlab:
     repositories:
       storages:
         default:
           gitaly_address: tls://praefect1.internal:3305
           path: /some/dummy/path
         storage1:
           gitaly_address: tls://praefect2.internal:3305
           path: /some/dummy/path
   ```

   NOTE: **Note:**
   `/some/dummy/path` should be set to a local folder that exists, however no
   data will be stored in this folder. This will no longer be necessary after
   [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/1282) is resolved.

1. Save the file and [restart GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#installations-from-source).
1. Copy all Praefect server certificates, or their certificate authority, to the system
   trusted certificates on each Gitaly server so the Praefect server will trust the
   certificate when called by Gitaly servers:

   ```shell
   sudo cp cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/praefect.crt
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

1. Edit `/home/git/praefect/config.toml` and add:

   ```toml
   tls_listen_addr = '0.0.0.0:3305'

   [tls]
   certificate_path = '/etc/gitlab/ssl/cert.pem'
   key_path = '/etc/gitlab/ssl/key.pem'
   ```

1. Save the file and [restart GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#installations-from-source).

### Gitaly

NOTE: **Note:**
Complete these steps for **each** Gitaly node.

To complete this section you will need:

- [Configured Praefect node](#praefect)
- 3 (or more) servers, with GitLab installed, to be configured as Gitaly nodes.
  These should be dedicated nodes, do not run other services on these nodes.

Every Gitaly server assigned to the Praefect cluster needs to be configured. The
configuration is the same as a normal [standalone Gitaly server](index.md),
except:

- the storage names are exposed to Praefect, not GitLab
- the secret token is shared with Praefect, not GitLab

The configuration of all Gitaly nodes in the Praefect cluster can be identical,
because we rely on Praefect to route operations correctly.

Particular attention should be shown to:

- the `gitaly['auth_token']` configured in this section must match the `token`
  value under `praefect['virtual_storages']` on the Praefect node. This was set
  in the [previous section](#praefect). This document uses the placeholder
  `PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN` throughout.
- the storage names in `git_data_dirs` configured in this section must match the
  storage names under `praefect['virtual_storages']` on the Praefect node. This
  was set in the [previous section](#praefect). This document uses `gitaly-1`,
  `gitaly-2`, and `gitaly-3` as Gitaly storage names.

For more information on Gitaly server configuration, see our [Gitaly
documentation](index.md#configure-gitaly-servers).

1. SSH into the **Gitaly** node and login as root:

   ```shell
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Disable all other services by editing `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   # Disable all other services on the Praefect node
   postgresql['enable'] = false
   redis['enable'] = false
   nginx['enable'] = false
   grafana['enable'] = false
   puma['enable'] = false
   sidekiq['enable'] = false
   gitlab_workhorse['enable'] = false
   prometheus_monitoring['enable'] = false

   # Enable only the Gitaly service
   gitaly['enable'] = true

   # Enable Prometheus if needed
   prometheus['enable'] = true

   # Prevent database connections during 'gitlab-ctl reconfigure'
   gitlab_rails['rake_cache_clear'] = false
   gitlab_rails['auto_migrate'] = false
   ```

1. Configure **Gitaly** to listen on network interfaces by editing
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   # Make Gitaly accept connections on all network interfaces.
   # Use firewalls to restrict access to this address/port.
   gitaly['listen_addr'] = '0.0.0.0:8075'

   # Enable Prometheus metrics access to Gitaly. You must use firewalls
   # to restrict access to this address/port.
   gitaly['prometheus_listen_addr'] = '0.0.0.0:9236'
   ```

1. Configure a strong `auth_token` for **Gitaly** by editing
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. This will be needed by clients to communicate with
   this Gitaly nodes. Typically, this token will be the same for all Gitaly
   nodes.

   ```ruby
   gitaly['auth_token'] = 'PRAEFECT_INTERNAL_TOKEN'
   ```

1. Configure the GitLab Shell `secret_token`, and `internal_api_url` which are
   needed for `git push` operations.

   If you have already configured [Gitaly on its own server](index.md)

   ```ruby
   gitlab_shell['secret_token'] = 'GITLAB_SHELL_SECRET_TOKEN'

   # Configure the gitlab-shell API callback URL. Without this, `git push` will
   # fail. This can be your front door GitLab URL or an internal load balancer.
   # Examples: 'https://example.gitlab.com', 'http://1.2.3.4'
   gitlab_rails['internal_api_url'] = 'http://GITLAB_HOST'
   ```

1. Configure the storage location for Git data by setting `git_data_dirs` in
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`. Each Gitaly node should have a unique storage name
   (such as `gitaly-1`).

   Instead of configuring `git_data_dirs` uniquely for each Gitaly node, it is
   often easier to have include the configuration for all Gitaly nodes on every
   Gitaly node. This is supported because the Praefect `virtual_storages`
   configuration maps each storage name (such as `gitaly-1`) to a specific node, and
   requests are routed accordingly. This means every Gitaly node in your fleet
   can share the same configuration.

   ```ruby
   # You can include the data dirs for all nodes in the same config, because
   # Praefect will only route requests according to the addresses provided in the
   # prior step.
   git_data_dirs({
     "gitaly-1" => {
       "path" => "/var/opt/gitlab/git-data"
     },
     "gitaly-2" => {
       "path" => "/var/opt/gitlab/git-data"
     },
     "gitaly-3" => {
       "path" => "/var/opt/gitlab/git-data"
     }
   })
   ```

1. Save the changes to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and [reconfigure
   Gitaly](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure):

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. To ensure that Gitaly [has updated its Prometheus listen
   address](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2734), [restart
   Gitaly](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-restart):

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl restart gitaly
   ```

**The steps above must be completed for each Gitaly node!**

After all Gitaly nodes are configured, you can run the Praefect connection
checker to verify Praefect can connect to all Gitaly servers in the Praefect
config.

1. SSH into the **Praefect** node and run the Praefect connection checker:

   ```shell
   sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml dial-nodes
   ```

### Load Balancer

In a highly available Gitaly configuration, a load balancer is needed to route
internal traffic from the GitLab application to the Praefect nodes. The
specifics on which load balancer to use or the exact configuration is beyond the
scope of the GitLab documentation.

We hope that if you’re managing HA systems like GitLab, you have a load balancer
of choice already. Some examples include [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)
(open-source), [Google Internal Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/),
[AWS Elastic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), F5
Big-IP LTM, and Citrix Net Scaler. This documentation will outline what ports
and protocols you need configure.

| LB Port | Backend Port | Protocol |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| 2305    | 2305         | TCP      |

### GitLab

To complete this section you will need:

- [Configured Praefect node](#praefect)
- [Configured Gitaly nodes](#gitaly)

The Praefect cluster needs to be exposed as a storage location to the GitLab
application. This is done by updating the `git_data_dirs`.

Particular attention should be shown to:

- the storage name added to `git_data_dirs` in this section must match the
  storage name under `praefect['virtual_storages']` on the Praefect node. This
  was set in the [Praefect](#praefect) section of this guide. This document uses
  `storage-1` as the Praefect storage name.

1. SSH into the **GitLab** node and login as root:

   ```shell
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Configure the `external_url` so that files could be served by GitLab
   by proper endpoint access by editing `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   You will need to replace `GITLAB_SERVER_URL` with the real external facing
   URL on which current GitLab instance is serving:

   ```ruby
   external_url 'GITLAB_SERVER_URL'
   ```

1. Disable the default Gitaly service running on the GitLab host. It won't be needed
   as GitLab will connect to the configured cluster.

   CAUTION: **Caution:**
   If you have existing data stored on the default Gitaly storage,
   you should [migrate the data your Praefect storage first](#migrating-existing-repositories-to-praefect).

   ```ruby
   gitaly['enable'] = false
   ```

1. Add the Praefect cluster as a storage location by editing
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

   You will need to replace:

   - `LOAD_BALANCER_SERVER_ADDRESS` with the IP address or hostname of the load
     balancer.
   - `PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN` with the real secret

   ```ruby
   git_data_dirs({
     "default" => {
       "gitaly_address" => "tcp://LOAD_BALANCER_SERVER_ADDRESS:2305",
       "gitaly_token" => 'PRAEFECT_EXTERNAL_TOKEN'
     }
   })
   ```

1. Configure the `gitlab_shell['secret_token']` so that callbacks from Gitaly
   nodes during a `git push` are properly authenticated by editing
   `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   You will need to replace `GITLAB_SHELL_SECRET_TOKEN` with the real secret.

   ```ruby
   gitlab_shell['secret_token'] = 'GITLAB_SHELL_SECRET_TOKEN'
   ```

1. Add Prometheus monitoring settings by editing `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

   You will need to replace:

   - `PRAEFECT_HOST` with the IP address or hostname of the Praefect node
   - `GITALY_HOST` with the IP address or hostname of each Gitaly node

   ```ruby
   prometheus['scrape_configs'] = [
     {
       'job_name' => 'praefect',
       'static_configs' => [
         'targets' => [
           'PRAEFECT_HOST:9652', # praefect-1
           'PRAEFECT_HOST:9652', # praefect-2
           'PRAEFECT_HOST:9652', # praefect-3
         ]
       ]
     },
     {
       'job_name' => 'praefect-gitaly',
       'static_configs' => [
         'targets' => [
           'GITALY_HOST:9236', # gitaly-1
           'GITALY_HOST:9236', # gitaly-2
           'GITALY_HOST:9236', # gitaly-3
         ]
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

1. Save the changes to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and [reconfigure GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure):

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. Verify each `gitlab-shell` on each Gitaly instance can reach GitLab. On each Gitaly instance run:

   ```shell
   /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell/bin/check -config /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell/config.yml
   ```

1. Verify that GitLab can reach Praefect:

   ```shell
   gitlab-rake gitlab:gitaly:check
   ```

1. Check in **Admin Area > Settings > Repository > Repository storage** that the Praefect storage
   is configured to store new repositories. Following this guide, the `default` storage should have
   weight 100 to store all new repositories.

1. Verify everything is working by creating a new project. Check the
   "Initialize repository with a README" box so that there is content in the
   repository that viewed. If the project is created, and you can see the
   README file, it works!

### Grafana

Grafana is included with GitLab, and can be used to monitor your Praefect
cluster. See [Grafana Dashboard
Service](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/grafana.html)
for detailed documentation.

To get started quickly:

1. SSH into the **GitLab** node and login as root:

   ```shell
   sudo -i
   ```

1. Enable the Grafana login form by editing `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

   ```ruby
   grafana['disable_login_form'] = false
   ```

1. Save the changes to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and [reconfigure
   GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure):

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. Set the Grafana admin password. This command will prompt you to enter a new
   password:

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl set-grafana-password
   ```

1. In your web browser, open `/-/grafana` (e.g.
   `https://gitlab.example.com/-/grafana`) on your GitLab server.

   Login using the password you set, and the username `admin`.

1. Go to **Explore** and query `gitlab_build_info` to verify that you are
   getting metrics from all your machines.

Congratulations! You've configured an observable highly available Praefect
cluster.

## Distributed reads

> Introduced in GitLab 13.1 in [beta](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#alpha-beta-ga) with feature flag `gitaly_distributed_reads` set to disabled.

Praefect supports distribution of read operations across Gitaly nodes that are
configured for the virtual node.

To allow for [performance testing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/-/issues/231),
distributed reads are currently in
[beta](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#alpha-beta-ga) and disabled by
default. To enable distributed reads, the `gitaly_distributed_reads`
[feature flag](../feature_flags.md) must be enabled in a Ruby console:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:gitaly_distributed_reads)
```

If enabled, all RPCs marked with `ACCESSOR` option like
[GetBlob](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/v12.10.6/proto/blob.proto#L16)
are redirected to an up to date and healthy Gitaly node.

_Up to date_ in this context means that:

- There is no replication operations scheduled for this node.
- The last replication operation is in _completed_ state.

If there is no such nodes, or any other error occurs during node selection, the primary
node will be chosen to serve the request.

To track distribution of read operations, you can use the `gitaly_praefect_read_distribution`
Prometheus counter metric. It has two labels:

- `virtual_storage`.
- `storage`.

They reflect configuration defined for this instance of Praefect.

## Strong consistency

> Introduced in GitLab 13.1 in [alpha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#alpha-beta-ga), disabled by default.

Praefect guarantees eventual consistency by replicating all writes to secondary nodes
after the write to the primary Gitaly node has happened.

Praefect can instead provide strong consistency by creating a transaction and writing
changes to all Gitaly nodes at once. Strong consistency is currently in
[alpha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#alpha-beta-ga) and not enabled by
default. If enabled, transactions are only available for a subset of RPCs. For more
information, see the [strong consistency epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1189).

To enable strong consistency:

- In GitLab 13.2 and later, enable the `:gitaly_reference_transactions` feature flag.
- In GitLab 13.1, enable the `:gitaly_reference_transactions` and `:gitaly_hooks_rpc`
  feature flags.

Enabling feature flags requires [access to the Rails console](../feature_flags.md#start-the-gitlab-rails-console).
In the Rails console, enable or disable the flags as required. For example:

```ruby
Feature.enable(:gitaly_reference_transactions)
```

To monitor strong consistency, use the `gitaly_praefect_transactions_total` and
`gitaly_praefect_transactions_delay_seconds` Prometheus counter metrics.

## Automatic failover and leader election

Praefect regularly checks the health of each backend Gitaly node. This
information can be used to automatically failover to a new primary node if the
current primary node is found to be unhealthy.

- **PostgreSQL (recommended):** Enabled by default, and equivalent to:
  `praefect['failover_election_strategy'] = sql`. This configuration
  option will allow multiple Praefect nodes to coordinate via the
  PostgreSQL database to elect a primary Gitaly node. This configuration
  will cause Praefect nodes to elect a new primary, monitor its health,
  and elect a new primary if the current one has not been reachable in
  10 seconds by a majority of the Praefect nodes.
- **Manual:** Automatic failover is disabled. The primary node can be
  reconfigured in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` on the Praefect node. Modify the
  `praefect['virtual_storages']` field by moving the `primary = true` to promote
  a different Gitaly node to primary. In the steps above, `gitaly-1` was set to
  the primary. Requires `praefect['failover_enabled'] = false` in the configuration.
- **Memory:** Enabled by setting `praefect['failover_election_strategy'] = 'local'`
  in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` on the Praefect node. If a sufficient number of health
  checks fail for the current primary backend Gitaly node, and new primary will
  be elected. **Do not use with multiple Praefect nodes!** Using with multiple
  Praefect nodes is likely to result in a split brain.

It is likely that we will implement support for Consul, and a cloud native
strategy in the future.

## Primary Node Failure

Praefect recovers from a failing primary Gitaly node by promoting a healthy secondary as the new primary. To minimize data loss, Praefect elects the secondary with the least unreplicated writes from the primary. There can still be some unreplicated writes, leading to data loss.

Praefect switches a virtual storage in to read-only mode after a failover event. This eases data recovery efforts by preventing new, possibly conflicting writes to the newly elected primary. This allows the administrator to attempt recovering the lost data before allowing new writes.

If you prefer write availability over consistency, this behavior can be turned off by setting `praefect['failover_read_only_after_failover'] = false` in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and [reconfiguring Praefect](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure).

### Checking for data loss

The Praefect `dataloss` sub-command helps identify lost writes by checking for uncompleted replication jobs. This is useful for identifying possible data loss cases after a failover. This command must be executed on a Praefect node.

```shell
sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml dataloss [-virtual-storage <virtual-storage>]
```

If the virtual storage is not specified, every configured virtual storage is checked for data loss.

```shell
sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml dataloss
```

```shell
Virtual storage: default
  Current read-only primary: gitaly-2
  Previous write-enabled primary: gitaly-1
    Nodes with data loss from failing over from gitaly-1:
      @hashed/2c/62/2c624232cdd221771294dfbb310aca000a0df6ac8b66b696d90ef06fdefb64a3.git: gitaly-0
      @hashed/4b/22/4b227777d4dd1fc61c6f884f48641d02b4d121d3fd328cb08b5531fcacdabf8a.git: gitaly-0, gitaly-2
```

Currently `dataloss` only considers a repository up to date if it has been directly replicated to from the previous write-enabled primary. While reconciling from an up to date secondary can recover the data, this is not visible in the data loss report. This is due for improvement via [Gitaly#2866](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2866).

NOTE: **Note:**
`dataloss` is still in beta and the output format is subject to change.

### Checking repository checksums

To check a project's repository checksums across on all Gitaly nodes, run the
[replicas Rake task](../raketasks/praefect.md#replica-checksums) on the main GitLab node.

### Recovering lost writes

The Praefect `reconcile` sub-command can be used to recover lost writes from the
previous primary once it is back online. This is only possible when the virtual storage
is still in read-only mode.

```shell
sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml reconcile -virtual <virtual-storage> -reference <previous-primary> -target <current-primary> -f
```

Refer to [Backend Node Recovery](#backend-node-recovery) section for more details on
the `reconcile` sub-command.

### Enabling Writes

Any data recovery attempts should have been made before enabling writes to eliminate
any chance of conflicting writes. Virtual storage can be re-enabled for writes by using
the Praefect `enable-writes` sub-command.

```shell
sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml enable-writes -virtual-storage <virtual-storage>
```

## Backend Node Recovery

When a Praefect backend node fails and is no longer able to
replicate changes, the backend node will start to drift from the primary. If
that node eventually recovers, it will need to be reconciled with the current
primary. The primary node is considered the single source of truth for the
state of a shard. The Praefect `reconcile` sub-command allows for the manual
reconciliation between a backend node and the current primary.

Run the following command on the Praefect server after all placeholders
(`<virtual-storage>` and `<target-storage>`) have been replaced:

```shell
sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/praefect -config /var/opt/gitlab/praefect/config.toml reconcile -virtual <virtual-storage> -target <target-storage>
```

- Replace the placeholder `<virtual-storage>` with the virtual storage containing the backend node storage to be checked.
- Replace the placeholder `<target-storage>` with the backend storage name.

The command will return a list of repositories that were found to be
inconsistent against the current primary. Each of these inconsistencies will
also be logged with an accompanying replication job ID.

## Migrating existing repositories to Praefect

If your GitLab instance already has repositories, these won't be migrated
automatically.

Repositories may be moved from one storage location using the [Repository
API](../../api/projects.html#edit-project):

```shell
curl --request PUT --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" --data "repository_storage=praefect" https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/123
```

## Debugging Praefect

If you receive an error, check `/var/log/gitlab/gitlab-rails/production.log`.

Here are common errors and potential causes:

- 500 response code
  - **ActionView::Template::Error (7:permission denied)**
    - `praefect['auth_token']` and `gitlab_rails['gitaly_token']` do not match on the GitLab server.
  - **Unable to save project. Error: 7:permission denied**
    - Secret token in `praefect['storage_nodes']` on GitLab server does not match the
      value in `gitaly['auth_token']` on one or more Gitaly servers.
- 503 response code
  - **GRPC::Unavailable (14:failed to connect to all addresses)**
    - GitLab was unable to reach Praefect.
  - **GRPC::Unavailable (14:all SubCons are in TransientFailure...)**
    - Praefect cannot reach one or more of its child Gitaly nodes. Try running
      the Praefect connection checker to diagnose.
