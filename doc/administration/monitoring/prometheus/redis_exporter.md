# Redis exporter

>**Note:**
Available since [Omnibus GitLab 8.17](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/1118).
For installations from source you'll have to install and configure it yourself.

The [Redis exporter](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) allows you to measure
various [Redis](https://redis.io) metrics. For more information on what's exported,
[read the upstream documentation](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter/blob/master/README.md#whats-exported).

To enable the Redis exporter:

1. [Enable Prometheus](index.md#configuring-prometheus)
1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`
1. Add or find and uncomment the following line, making sure it's set to `true`:

   ```ruby
   redis_exporter['enable'] = true
   ```

1. Save the file and [reconfigure GitLab](../../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure)
   for the changes to take effect.

Prometheus will now automatically begin collecting performance data from
the Redis exporter exposed under `localhost:9121`.
