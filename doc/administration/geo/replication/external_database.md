# Geo with external PostgreSQL instances

This document is relevant if you are using a PostgreSQL instance that is *not
managed by Omnibus*. This includes cloud-managed instances like AWS RDS, or
manually installed and configured PostgreSQL instances.

NOTE: **Note**:
We strongly recommend running Omnibus-managed instances as they are actively
developed and tested. We aim to be compatible with most external
(not managed by Omnibus) databases but we do not guarantee compatibility.

## **Primary** node

### Configure the external database to be replicated

To set up an external database, you can either:

- Set up streaming replication yourself (for example, in AWS RDS).
- Perform the Omnibus configuration manually as follows.

In an Omnibus install, the
[geo_primary_role](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/roles/#gitlab-geo-roles)
configures the **primary** node's database to be replicated by making changes to
`pg_hba.conf` and `postgresql.conf`. Make the following configuration changes
manually to your external database configuration:

```
##
## Geo Primary Role
## - pg_hba.conf
##
host    replication gitlab_replicator <trusted secondary IP>/32     md5
```

```
##
## Geo Primary Role
## - postgresql.conf
##
sql_replication_user = gitlab_replicator
wal_level = hot_standby
max_wal_senders = 10
wal_keep_segments = 50
max_replication_slots = 1 # number of secondary instances
hot_standby = on
```

## **Secondary** nodes

With Omnibus, the
[geo_secondary_role](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/roles/#gitlab-geo-roles)
has three main functions:

1. Configure the replica database.
1. Configure the tracking database.
1. Enable the Geo Log Cursor (`geo_logcursor`) (irrelevant to this doc).

### Configure the external replica database

To set up an external replica database, you can either:

- Set up streaming replication yourself (for example, in AWS RDS).
- Perform the Omnibus configuration manually as follows.

In an Omnibus install, the `geo_secondary_role` makes configuration changes to
`postgresql.conf`. Make the following configuration changes manually to your
external replica database configuration:

```
##
## Geo Secondary Role
## - postgresql.conf
##
wal_level = hot_standby
max_wal_senders = 10
wal_keep_segments = 10
hot_standby = on
```

### Configure the tracking database

**Secondary** nodes use a separate PostgreSQL installation as a tracking
database to keep track of replication status and automatically recover from
potential replication issues.

It requires an [FDW](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/postgres-fdw.html)
connection with the **secondary** replica database for improved performance.

If you have an external database ready to be used as the tracking database,
follow the instructions below to use it:

1. SSH into a GitLab **secondary** server and login as root:

    ```bash
    sudo -i
    ```

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` with the connection params and credentials for
    the machine with the PostgreSQL instance:

    ```ruby
    # note this is shared between both databases,
    # make sure you define the same password in both
    gitlab_rails['db_password'] = 'mypassword'

    geo_secondary['db_host'] = '<tracking_database_public_ip_address>'
    geo_secondary['db_port'] = <tracking_database_port>      # change to the correct port
    geo_secondary['db_fdw'] = true       # enable FDW
    geo_postgresql['enable'] = false     # don't use internal managed instance
    ```

1. Reconfigure GitLab for the changes to take effect:

    ```bash
    gitlab-ctl reconfigure
    ```

1. Run the tracking database migrations:

    ```bash
    gitlab-rake geo:db:migrate
    ```

1. Configure the
    [PostgreSQL FDW](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/postgres-fdw.html)
    connection and credentials:

    Save the script below in a file, ex. `/tmp/geo_fdw.sh` and modify the connection
    params to match your environment. Execute it to set up the FDW connection.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Secondary Database connection params:
    DB_HOST="<public_IP_or_VPC_private_IP>"
    DB_NAME="gitlabhq_production"
    DB_USER="gitlab"
    DB_PORT="5432"

    # Tracking Database connection params:
    GEO_DB_HOST="<public_IP_or_VPC_private_IP>"
    GEO_DB_NAME="gitlabhq_geo_production"
    GEO_DB_USER="gitlab_geo"
    GEO_DB_PORT="5432"

    query_exec () {
      gitlab-psql -h $GEO_DB_HOST -d $GEO_DB_NAME -p $GEO_DB_PORT -c "${1}"
    }

    query_exec "CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;"
    query_exec "CREATE SERVER gitlab_secondary FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (host '${DB_HOST}', dbname '${DB_NAME}', port '${DB_PORT}');"
    query_exec "CREATE USER MAPPING FOR ${GEO_DB_USER} SERVER gitlab_secondary OPTIONS (user '${DB_USER}');"
    query_exec "CREATE SCHEMA gitlab_secondary;"
    query_exec "GRANT USAGE ON FOREIGN SERVER gitlab_secondary TO ${GEO_DB_USER};"
    ```

    NOTE: **Note:** The script template above uses `gitlab-psql` as it's intended to be executed from the Geo machine,
    but you can change it to `psql` and run it from any machine that has access to the database.

1. Restart GitLab:

    ```bash
    gitlab-ctl restart
    ```
1. Populate the FDW tables:

    ```bash
    gitlab-rake geo:db:refresh_foreign_tables
    ```
