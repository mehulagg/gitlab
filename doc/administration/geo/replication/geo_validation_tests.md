# Geo validation tests **(PREMIUM ONLY)**

The Geo team performs manual testing and validation on common deployment configurations to ensure
that Geo works when upgrading between minor GitLab versions and major PostgreSQL database versions.

This section contains a journal of recent validation tests and links to the relevant issues.

## GitLab upgrades

The following are GitLab upgrade validation tests we performed.

### July 2020

[Upgrade Geo multi-node installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225359):

- Description: Tested upgrading from GitLab 12.10.12 to 13.0.10 package in a multi-node
  configuration. As part of the issue to [Fix zero-downtime upgrade process/instructions for multi-node Geo deployments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22568), we monitored for downtime using the looping pipeline, HAProxy stats dashboards, and a script to log readiness status on both nodes.
- Outcome: Partial success because we observed downtime during the upgrade of the primary and secondary sites.
- Follow up issues/actions:
  - [Investigate why `reconfigure` and `hup` cause downtime on multi-node Geo deployments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228898)
  - [Geo multi-node deployment upgrade: investigate order when upgrading non-deploy nodes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228954)

- Follow up issues/actions:
  - [Fix zero-downtime upgrade process/instructions for multi-node Geo deployments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225684)

## PostgreSQL upgrades

The following are PostgreSQL upgrade validation tests we performed.

### April 2020

[PostgreSQL 11 upgrade procedure for Geo installations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/4975):

- Description: Prior to making PostgreSQL 11 the default version of PostgreSQL in GitLab 12.10, we
  tested upgrading to PostgreSQL 11 in Geo deployments on GitLab 12.9.
- Outcome: Partially successful. Issues were discovered in multi-node configurations with a separate
  tracking database and concerns were raised about allowing automatic upgrades when Geo enabled.
- Follow up issues:
  - [`replicate-geo-database` incorrectly tries to back up repositories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5241).
  - [`pg-upgrade` fails to upgrade a standalone Geo tracking database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5242).
  - [`revert-pg-upgrade` fails to downgrade the PostgreSQL data of a Geo secondaryâ€™s standalone tracking database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5243).
  - [Timeout error on Geo secondary read-replica near the end of `gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5235).

[Verify Geo installation with PostgreSQL 11](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/4971):

- Description: Prior to making PostgreSQL 11 the default version of PostgreSQL in GitLab 12.10, we
  tested fresh installations of GitLab 12.9 with Geo installed with PostgreSQL 11.
- Outcome: Installation test was successful.

### September 2019

[Test and validate PostgreSQL 10.0 upgrade for Geo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12092):

- Description: With the 12.0 release, GitLab required an upgrade to PostgreSQL 10.0. We tested
  various upgrade scenarios from GitLab 11.11.5 through to GitLab 12.1.8.
- Outcome: Multiple issues were found when upgrading and addressed in follow-up issues.
- Follow up issues:
  - [`gitlab-ctl` reconfigure fails on Redis node in multi-node Geo setup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/4706).
