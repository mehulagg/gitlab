# Geo validation tests

The Geo team performs manual testing and validation on common deployment configurations to ensure
that Geo works when upgrading between minor GitLab versions and major PostgreSQL database versions.

This section contains a journal of recent validation tests and links to the relevant issues.

[PostgreSQL 11 upgrade procedure for Geo installations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/4975):

- Description: Prior to making PostgreSQL 11 the default version of PostgreSQL in GitLab 12.10, we
  tested upgrading to PostgreSQL 11 in Geo deployments on GitLab 12.9.
- Outcome: Partially successful. Issues were discovered in multi-server configurations with a separate
  tracking database and concerns were raised about allowing automatic upgrades when Geo enabled.
- Follow up issues:
  - [`replicate-geo-database` incorrectly tries to back up repositories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5241).
  - [`pg-upgrade` fails to upgrade a standalone Geo tracking database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5242).
  - [`revert-pg-upgrade` fails to downgrade the PostgreSQL data of a Geo secondaryâ€™s standalone tracking database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5243).
  - [Timeout error on Geo secondary read-replica near the end of `gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5235).

[Verify Geo installation with PostgreSQL 11](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/4971):

- Description: Prior to making PostgreSQL 11 the default version of PostgreSQL in GitLab 12.10, we
  tested fresh installations of GitLab 12.9 with Geo installed with PostgreSQL 11.
- Outcome: Installation test was successful.

### September 2019

[Test and validate PostgreSQL 10.0 upgrade for Geo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12092):

  various upgrade scenarios from GitLab 11.11.5 through to GitLab 12.1.8.
- Outcome: Multiple issues were found when upgrading and addressed in follow-up issues.
- Follow up issues:
  - [`gitlab-ctl` reconfigure fails on Redis node in multi-server Geo setup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/4706).
  - [Geo multi-server upgrade from 12.0.9 to 12.1.9 does not upgrade PostgreSQL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/4705).
