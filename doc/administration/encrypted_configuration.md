# Encrypted Configuration

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/45712) in GitLab 13.7.

GitLab can read settings for certain features from encrypted settings files. The features currently supported are:

- [LDAP user_bn and password](auth/ldap/index.md#using-encrypted-credentials-core-only)

In order to enable the encrypted configuration settings, a new base key needs to be generated in secrets.yml for
`enc_settings_key_base`. The secret can be generated in the following ways:

**Omnibus Installation**

In 13.7 the new secret is automatically generated for you, but you will need to ensure your
`/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json` contains the same values on all nodes.

**GitLab Cloud Native Helm Chart**

In 13.7 the new secret is automatically generated if you have the `shared-secrets` chart enabled. Otherwise you need
to follow the [secrets guide for adding the secret]().

**Source Installation**

The new secret can be generated by running:

```shell
bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production GITLAB_GENERATE_ENC_SETTINGS_KEY_BASE=true
```

This will print general info on the GitLab instance, but will also cause the key to be generated in `secrets.yml`
