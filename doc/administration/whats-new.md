# What's new **(FREE)**

With each monthly release, GitLab includes some of the highlights from the last 10
GitLab versions in the **What's new** feature. To access it:

1. In the top navigation bar, select the **{question}** icon.
1. Select **What's new** from the menu.

The **What's new** describes new features available in multiple
[GitLab tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing). While all users can see the
feature list, the feature list is tailored to your subscription type:

- Features only available to self-managed installations are not shown on GitLab.com.
- Features only available on GitLab.com are not shown to self-managed installations.

The **What's new** feature cannot be disabled, but
[is planned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/59011) for a future release.

## Self-managed installations

Due to our release post process, the content for **What's new** is not yet finalized
when a new version (`.0` release) is cut. The updated **What's new** is included
in the first patch release, such as `13.10.1`.
