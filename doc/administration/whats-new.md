# What's New **(ALL TIERS)**

With each monthly release, GitLab includes some of the highlights in the `What's new` feature. To access it, select the `?` icon and select `What's new` from the menu.

All users can see the items in What's New and features available across our different tiers are shown. Self-managed only features are not displayed in GitLab.com and vice versa. 

Content from the last 10 versions is shown, allowing you to scroll back to see updates from previous releases. 

What's new cannot be disabled. 

## How it works for self-managed 

Due to our release post process, the content for What's New is being finalized after the version is already cut. Because of this, we don't ship an updated What's New with the .0 release. It is included in the first patch release ex 13.10.1.
