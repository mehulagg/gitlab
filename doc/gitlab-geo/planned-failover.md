# GitLab Geo Planned Failover

A planned failover is similar to a disaster recovery scenario, except you are able
to notify users of the maintenance window, and allow data to finish replicating to
secondaries.

To avoid unnecessary downtime, please read this entire document as well as
[GitLab Geo Disaster Recovery](disaster-recovery.md) before proceeding.

### Notify users of scheduled maintenance

1. On the primary, in Admin Area > Messages, add a broadcast message.

    Check Admin Area > Geo Nodes to estimate how long it will take to finish syncing.

    ```
    We are doing scheduled maintenance at XX:XX UTC, expected to take less than 1 hour.
    ```

1. On the secondary, you may need to clear the cache for the broadcast message to show up.

### Block primary traffic

1. At the scheduled time, using your cloud provider or your node's firewall, block HTTP and SSH traffic to/from the primary except for your IP and the secondary's IP.

### Allow replication to finish as much as possible

1. On the secondary, navigate to Admin Area > Geo Nodes and wait until all replication progress is 100% on the secondary "Current node".

1. Navigate to Admin Area > Monitoring > Background Jobs > Queues and wait until the "geo" queues drop ideally to 0.

### Promote the secondary

1. Finally, follow [GitLab Geo Disaster Recovery](disaster-recovery.md) to promote the secondary to a primary.
