# Amazon Web Services Cognito

To enable the [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) OAuth2 OmniAuth provider, you must register your application with Cognito, and generate a client id and secret key for you to use.
This instruction contains minimum settings which allow to bring it to work.

1. Sign in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home).

1. Select **Cognito** from the **Services** menu.

1. Select **Manage User Pools**, and click the **Create a user pool** button in the top right corner.

1. Enter the pool name and then click the **Step through setting** button.

1. Select **Allow email addresses** and **email** from **standard attributes** section as required

1. Go to the next steps and set all other attributes as you need.

1. At the **App clients** settings click **Add an app client** and mark **Enable username password based authentication**. Create app.

1. In the next step, you can setup lambdas for sending emails, such as welcome emails, and finish creating the pool. All settings can be changed later.

1. After creating the user pool, go to **App client settings** and provide the required information:

   - **Enabled Identity Providers** - select all
   - **Callback URL** - `https://gitlab.example.com/users/auth/cognito/callback`
   - **Allowed OAuth Flows** - Authorization code grant
   - **Allowed OAuth Scopes** - `email` and `openid`

1. Under **Domain name** setup domain for your Cognito.

1. On your GitLab server, open the configuration file.

   For Omnibus package:

   ```shell
   sudo editor /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```shell
   cd /home/git/gitlab

   sudo -u git -H editor config/gitlab.yml
   ```

1. See [Initial OmniAuth Configuration](omniauth.md#initial-omniauth-configuration) for initial settings.

1. Add the provider configuration, replacing `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET` with the values from **App clients** in Cognito:

   For Omnibus package:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['omniauth_allow_single_sign_on'] = ['cognito']
   gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
     {
       "name" => "cognito",
       "app_id" => "CLIENT ID",
       "app_secret" => "CLIENT SECRET",
       "args" => {
         client_options: {
           'site' => 'https://your_domain.auth.your_region.amazoncognito.com',
           'authorize_url' => '/login',
           'token_url' => '/oauth2/token',
           'user_info_url' => '/oauth2/userInfo'
         },
         user_response_structure: {
           root_path: [],
           attributes: { nickname: 'email'}
         },
         name: 'cognito',
         strategy_class: "OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2Generic"
       }
     }
   ]
   ```

1. Save the configuration file.

1. [Reconfigure][] or [restart GitLab][] for the changes to take effect if you
   installed GitLab via Omnibus or from source respectively.

Your sign-in page should now display a Cognito button below the regular sign-in form. To begin the authentication process, click the icon, and AWS Cognito will ask the user to sign in and authorize the GitLab application. If successful, the user will be redirected back to GitLab, and signed in.
