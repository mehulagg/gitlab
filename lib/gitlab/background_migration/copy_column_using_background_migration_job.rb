    # Background migration that updates the value of a
    # column using the value of another column in the same table.
    #
    # - The {start_id, end_id} arguments are at the start so that it can be used
    #   with `queue_batched_background_migration`
    # - Uses sub-batching so that we can keep each update's execution time at
    #   low 100s ms, while being able to update more records per 2 minutes
    #   that we allow background migration jobs to be scheduled one after the other
    # - We skip the NULL checks as they may result in not using an index scan
    # - The table that is migrated does _not_ need `id` as the primary key
    #   We use the provided primary_key column to perform the update.
