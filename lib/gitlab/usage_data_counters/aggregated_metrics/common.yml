#- name: unique name of aggregated metric
#  operator: aggregation operator. Valid values are:
#             - "OR": counts unique elements that were observed triggering any of following events
#             - "AND": counts unique elements that were observed triggering all of following events
#  events: list of events names to aggregate into metric. All events in this list must have the same 'redis_slot' and 'aggregation' attributes
#           see from lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/known_events/ for the list of valid events.
#  feature_flag: name of development feature flag that will be checked before metrics aggregation is performed.
#                Corresponding feature flag should have `default_enabled` attribute set to `false`.
#                This attribute is OPTIONAL and can be omitted, when `feature_flag` is missing no feature flag will be checked.
