  # Event Dictionary

  This file is autogenerated, please do not edit directly.

  To generate these files from the GitLab repository, run:

  ```shell
  bundle exec rake gitlab:snowplow:generate_event_dictionary
  ```

  The Event Dictionary is based on the following event definition YAML files:

  - [`config/events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/events)
  - [`ee/config/events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/config/events)

  Each table includes a `milestone`, which corresponds to the GitLab version when the event
  was released.

  ## Event Definitions

\
- event_definitions.each do |name, object|

  = render_name(name)
  \
  = render_description(object.attributes)
  - if object.has_json_schema?
    \
    = render_object_schema(object)
  \
  = render_yaml_link(object.yaml_path)
  \
  = render_owner(object.attributes)
  \
  = render_status(object.attributes)
  \
  = render_tiers(object.attributes)
