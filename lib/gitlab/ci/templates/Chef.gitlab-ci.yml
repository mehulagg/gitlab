# This file uses Test Kitchen with the kitchen-dokken driver to
# perform functional testing. Doing so requires that your runner be a
# Docker runner configured for privileged mode. Please see
# https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#use-docker-in-docker-with-privileged-mode
# for help configuring your runner properly, or, if you want to switch
# to a different driver, see http://kitchen.ci/docs/drivers
