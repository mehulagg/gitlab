actions:

## Requirements

* Has global actions
* route/state specific actions can be added with plain JS
* Documented requirements for actions
* Action that requires Axios call
* Action that requires Apollo call

Merge merge request
Assign user
Go to settings (global)
Go to diffs (only MR)
Turn off command palette
Add label

Need to expose search_box_by_click icon if we want to reuse search box.

Good to reuse search tokens since this is a known UX component for the user.

## Should this support multiple commands at once?

### cons

* Makes for some interesting race conditions

### pros

* Users are used to this from quick actions
