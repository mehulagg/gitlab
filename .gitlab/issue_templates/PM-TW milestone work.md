A group technical writer should create an issue for the group with this template for each milestone by the first of *the month before* the milestone starts.

Add the milestone and assign the TW and PM of the group.

## Feature work

* By month M-1, 4th (at least 14 days before milestone m begins):
   * [ ] **PM:** Ensure all planned ~feature issues impacting any user view/workflow have:
      * a ~documentation label
      * a **Documentation** section in the description with minimum requirements (can be expanded during feature work);  
        this can include a recommendation that the TW actively partner with the dev, e.g. due to the complexity of the required content
      * Note: If the work has been broken down into multiple linked issues, only one may need these doc items or you can link out to a docs-specific issue. 
* By month M-1, 13th (at least 5 days before milestone m begins):
   * [ ] **TW:** Review the milestone's ~feature issues that do and do not have the ~documentation label, conferring with PM/group as needed.
   * [ ] **TW:** If any docs require deeper TW involvement, convert the Documentation requirements section into a linked issue assigned to you and the dev for the milestone.
* By month M, 10th
   * [ ] **PM:** Contribute release post content (feature items, Omnibus improvements, deprecation/removal notices, and more, as [described in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#pm-contributors)).
* By month M, 16th
   * [ ] **TW:** Ensure all docs and release post content is reviewed and merged (or ready to merge by the assignee).

## Docs-only work

* By month M-1, 4th (at least 14 days before milestone m begins):
   * [ ] **PM:** Confirm the doc issues slated for next milestone, assigning each to a Technical Writer or engineer to represent who will be the primary author.
* By month M-1, 13th (at least 5 days before milestone m begins):
   * [ ] **TW:** Review those issues and assignments, conferring with the PM or engineer as needed. Ensure the needs are clear and roles other than author are clear (who can provide info, examples, review, etc.) 
   * [ ] **TW:** Coordinate with stage/group TWs to ensure the next-higher-level PM (stage or section) reviews the set of issues assigned. If any TW would be over capacity, flag this.
       *  Higher-level PM should help decide priorities of issus across groups, especially in cases where TW is over capacity. 
   * [ ] **TW:** Update stage TW (or section TW if there is no stage TW) when the board is ready and let them know if you'd be over capacity across groups given the current scheduling.
      * The section TW will review planned issues 
* By month M, 17th
   * [ ] **TW:** Ensure content is reviewed and merged.

## Notes

This checklist should remain aligned with the:
