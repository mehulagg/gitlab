## Feature work

* By month M-1, 4th (at least 14 days before milestone m begins):
   * [ ] PM: Ensure all planned ~feature issues impacting any user view/workflow have:
      * a ~documentation label
      * a **Documentation** section in the description with minimum requirements (can be expanded during feature work);  
        this can include a recommendation that the TW actively partner with the dev, e.g. due to the complexity of the required content
* By month M-1, 13th (at least 5 days before milestone m begins):
   * [ ] TW: Review the milestone's ~feature issues that do and do not have the ~documentation label, conferring with PM/group to resolve disagreements/questions.
   * [ ] TW: If any docs require deeper TW involvement, convert the Documentation requirements section into a linked issue assigned to you and the dev for the milestone.
* By month M, 10th
   * [ ] PM: Contribute release post items, content for Omnibus improvements, deprecation warnings, and more, as [described in the Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#pm-contributors).
* By month M, 16th
   * [ ] TW: Ensure docs content is reviewed and ready to merge.

## Notes

This checklist should remain aligned with the:
* Release Post [Monthly Releases](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#monthly-releases) timeline.
* Engineering Handbook's [Product Development Timeline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline).
* [Product Development Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/).

Information should be moved to those pages as SSOT where possible, once approved by relevant cross-functional counterparts.
