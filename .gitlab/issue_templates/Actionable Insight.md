<!-- Actionable insights must recommend an action that needs to take place. An actionable insight both defines the insight and clearly calls out action or next step required to improve based on the result of the research observation or data. Actionable insights are tracked over time and will include follow-up. Learn more in the handbook here: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/research-insights/#actionable-insights -->

### Insight
<!-- Describe the insight itself: often the problem, finding, or observation. -->

### Supporting evidence
<!-- Describe why the problem is happening, or more details behind the finding or observation. Try to include quotes or specific data collected. Feel free to link the Actionable insight from Dovetail here if applicable instead of retyping details. -->

### Action
<!--Describe the next step or action that needs to take place as a result of the research. The action should be clearly defined, achievable, and directly tied back to the insight. Make sure to use directive terminology, such as: conduct, explore, redesign, etc. -->
