#
# This list of browsers is a conservative definition, based on
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#supported-web-browsers
# with the following reasoning:
#
# We should support the latest ESR of Firefox: 78, because it used quite a lot.
# For the rest, pick browser versions that have a similar age to Firefox 78.

chrome >= 78
edge >= 79
firefox >= 78
safari >= 13
