/**
 * This function uses the given factory and teardown to create a smart resource that whose
 * lifecycle is automatically handled.
 *
 * It returns a [resource, resourceFactory] where
 *
 * - `resource` is a proxy that wraps a deferred instance of whatever is created by `factory`.
 * - `resourceFactory` is a method which can be used to trigger the immediate creation of the underlying resource instance.
 *
 * Some notes!
 *
 * - factory() is **not** called right away.
 *   - It is called whenever the first time the resource is referenced (similar to `let()` in RSpec)
 *   - Or it is called whenever the resourceFactory is triggered
 * - teardown() is called in after each
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { useSmartResource, useFactoryArgs } from 'helpers/resources';
 *
 * describe('silly spec', () => {
 *   const [store] = useSmartResource(createStore);
 *   const [wrapper] = useSmartResource((props = {}) => shallowMount(MyComponent, { propsData: props, store }), x => x.destroy());
 *
 *   describe('with flag 2', () => {
 *     useFactoryArgs(wrapper, { flag: 2 });
 *
 *     // Now, whenever wrapper is created it will pass these arguments to the original factory
 *     // but only in this describe context
 *
 *     it('does things', () => {
 *       // Note that we don't need to explicitly createWrapper!
 *       expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('I have 2 flags');
 *     });
 *   });
 *
 *   it('works', () => {
 *     expect(wrapper.text()).toBe('');
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @template T
 * @returns { [T, (...args) => void] }
 * @param { (...args) => T } factory
 * @param { (T) => void } teardown
