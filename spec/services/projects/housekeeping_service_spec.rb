# This is a compatibility class to avoid calling a non-existent
# class from sidekiq during deployment.
#
# We're deploying the name of the referenced class in 13.9. Nevertheless,
# we cannot remove the class entirely because there can be jobs
# referencing it. We still need this specs to ensure that the old
# class still has the old behavior.
#
# We can get rid of this class in 13.10
