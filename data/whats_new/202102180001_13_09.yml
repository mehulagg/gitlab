- title: "Select CI/CD configuration from any job and reuse it"
  body: |
    Previously, if you wanted to reuse the same configuration in multiple jobs, you had two options: add YAML anchors, which don't work across different configuration files, or use `extends` to reuse an entire section.

    In this release, we've added a new YAML function called `!reference`, which lets you target the exact configuration you want to reuse as part of your CI/CD pipeline, even if it's in another file.
