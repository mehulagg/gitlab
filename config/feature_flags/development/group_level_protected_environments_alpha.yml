# Important note:
# This feature is alpha version that was built for allowing prospects
# to test if it's a proper solution in their SLDC workflow.
# The alpha version will never be rolled out on gitlab.com globally, nor announced
# as a new feature in a release blogpost.
# After the feature has been confirmed as viable solution, we'll spend additional
# effort to make it GA. There is even a possibility that we remove this feature.
# See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215888 for more information.
