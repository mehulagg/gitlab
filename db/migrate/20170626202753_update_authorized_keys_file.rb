      If you did not intentionally disable the "Write to authorized_keys file"
      option in Application Settings as outlined in the Speed up SSH
      documentation,

      https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/speed_up_ssh.html

      then the authorized_keys file may be out-of-date, affecting SSH
      operations.

      If you are affected, please check the "Write to authorized_keys file"
      checkbox, and Save. Then rebuild the authorized_keys file as shown here:

      https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/raketasks/maintenance.html#rebuild-authorized_keys-file
