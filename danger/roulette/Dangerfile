## Reviewer roulette

Changes that require review have been detected! A merge request is normally
reviewed by both a reviewer and a maintainer in its primary category (e.g.
~frontend or ~backend), and by a maintainer in all other categories.
MARKDOWN

CATEGORY_TABLE_HEADER = <<MARKDOWN

To spread load more evenly across eligible reviewers, Danger has randomly picked
a candidate for each review slot. Feel free to
[override these selections](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab)
if you think someone else would be better-suited, or the chosen person is unavailable.

To read more on how to use the reviewer roulette, please take a look at the
[Engineering workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#basics)
and [code review guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html).

Once you've decided who will review this merge request, mention them as you
normally would! Danger does not (yet?) automatically notify them for you.

| Category | Reviewer | Maintainer |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |

UNKNOWN_FILES_MESSAGE = <<MARKDOWN

These files couldn't be categorised, so Danger was unable to suggest a reviewer.
Please consider creating a merge request to
[add support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/danger/helper.rb)
for them.
